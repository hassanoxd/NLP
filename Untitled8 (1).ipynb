              "\"lovely delicate , fragrant rhone wine . polished leather and strawberries . perhaps a bit dilute , but good for drinking now . *** liquorice , cherry fruit . simple and coarse at the finish . ** thin and completely uninspiring . * rough . no stars big , fat , textured chardonnay - nuts and butterscotch . a slightly odd metallic/cardboard finish , but probably *** a blind tasting , other than the fizz , which included five vintages of cote rotie brune et blonde from guigal . surprisingly young feeling and drinking well , but without any great complexity . a good *** charming , violet-fragranced nose . classic guigal cote rotie . **** good grip and a touch of rusticity on the length . va showing through . on the downhill slope . just **** just about holding together - drying out a touch at the finish . not as good as i thought this would be . a good *** in your face wine - rather obvious and simple ( although some structure did begin to show through ) . *** some volatility , and all over the place on the nose and palate . it did come together more with time . *** gummy nose , merlot-style sweetness . good wine , but not in a style i was expecting . **** hot on the palate , but good balance with some maturity . *** this has a rhonish air to it , feels quite young , but it is also a bit simple . *** liquorice . fruit beginning to dry out . ** good sweetly fragranced wine . drink now . top *** a big nose of public swimming pools - bizarre ( some might say funky ) . * very vinous - burgundy with bubbles , to some extent and so a bit much in some ways . i suspect it needs time to mellow - it will be interesting to see how this develops ( this bottle was disgorged only last year ) . if all goes well *** ( * ) all quite refined and delicate , appley pinot fruit , autolytic flavours . another fairly recent disgorgement after 4 years in cellars ( credit the producer for an excellent back label ) , it just seems a bit lacking in intensity despite the obvious quality . perhaps this will develop but for now a good *** good fruit - nice acidity . pretty intense although it seems quite evolved for a young wine - i fear it may go down the ozzy route of rather early flabby kerosene flavours . top ** curiously sauvignon-like - quite rich . odd balance - people were saying this is a vineyard huet took on and then abandoned . good wine but it does n't seem to have the class of their major wines . a low ** ( * ) pretty nice . clean , rich , yet decently taught . a credit to the appelation . bare *** a weak cork and a rather oxidised bottle - one sips for a while but then abandons it . i have had much better . not rated very light and delicate - decent but a bit attenuated . i have had better bottles . *** dry , savoury , quite succulent . pleasantly high-toned , nervy , and a bit awkward . a wine with a sense of place and hence enjoyable . *** curiously quiet , but concentration and fruit quality are all there . maybe just in a dull phase - perhaps it would have shown better decanted and allowed a little air . *** leafy , dry , decent balance . good wine but i doubt it 's going anywhere much . pleasant , and perhaps it would reward further attention . ** quite baked , decent concentration - slightly hot finish . i recall having had better from this producer . ** refined , smooth sweet ( to a controlled extent ) - very drinkable . forward fruit but with the balance to hold it - the best of the new world reds , to my palate . top *** huge monster - alcohol gets up my a nose and in my throat rather . i find this a bit much . returning to it later it seemed to have mellowed quite a bit and to be a substantial wine in its way , although i find it hard to decide about it . many will admire this , and i may too given time to consider it - i had it eight and a half years ago and was impressed . i think i 'll reserve judgement for now . not rated a bit anonymous in some ways , but very nicely poised fairly concentrated dessert wine - from the south of france somewhere , i guess . i suspect this would repay more attention and on that basis *** beautifully refined . complex , elegant , long with the amazing precision so typical of the producer . lovely . **** eccentric - very rancio - complex and interesting - i need more time with this but for now *** raspingly dry , mineral , appley , severe , touch of honey developing , long . *** ( * ) very fresh , lifted , aromatic . top * dry , clean , unassuming . touch of spritz . * fruity , peachy . dry again . more richness . nice sense of place . i could even think of *** quite mouthfilling - dry , fruity . nice . ** soft , cigar cassis fruit - sweet finish . pleasant . nice condition . *** soft blackcurrant fruit - with tannic background that starts to show in the midpalate . odd balance . ** a bit stinky at first - resolves - tar roses but the common old barolo oxidativeness . tarry - quite hard work . actually probably good . top *** rich again - gamy animal dry - could do with long decanting . bare **** dark orange . very barley-sugar - nice balance - appetizing finish . *** slightly lighter , fruitier . slightly oily textured . bare *** a bit faded , pleasant , lightweight . bare *** charming tempranillo sweet strawberry nose . good balance and elegant . a good *** modern stuff , rather lacking depth and complexity . ** at peak or just over . rather like a decent cotes-du-rhone , with a rustic edge . *** pretty awful - very soft and commercial . confected . * a couple of wines from a big bash at an edinburgh hotel . it 's a good idea once in a while to remember where the baseline is . clean , pretty dry , but low on real concentration . a respectable no stars clean again , clearly rather dilute , quite leafy and a touch of ( not necessarily bad ) green-ness . again a respectable no stars each done as a vertical - single blind a slightly embarrassing start to the evening with people thinking this was vintage ( 1990 or 1996 ) , possibly krug , possibly billecart . lovely wine whatever . a touch of pink on the colour - a blush to cover our blushes . elegant , good length and fine balanced acidity . a really good , cheap ( under 15 ) fizz . **** mature with grenache cherry showing through . charming nose . slightly simple on the palate . a good *** slightly flat liquorice nose . more depth than the 98 . closed up and allowing the alcohol to show through , but i think this will come together well . *** ( * ) a touch gummy and with a hint of leather . drier than many . robust . **** youthful ( obviously the youngest wine of this flight ) . powerful wine with lovely softy tannins at the end . ** ( ** ) past its peak , although still very drinkable . fruit is starting to dry out and a touch of volatility is appearing . ** this vintage had a juiciness about the fruit that was lacking in the other wines , but was also maturing well - at an in-between phase i guess . *** corked . not rated green tannins , dry at the end , a long , soft , not that pleasant leathery length . *** vegetal blackcurrant . soft and not together . ** very young and closed . minty . but does it have the structure ? *** a stinky nose to start with . leather , and just beginning to dry out . *** a touch vegetal , and some volatility . just *** a bit of blackcurrant , clean and nicely together . a top *** some thought this stunk rather . i thought it the finest wine of this flight . lovely fragrant mature shiraz nose . at peak . good . **** toffeed , bit dry , volatile . no stars cream crackers on the nose ( no that 's not rhyming slang ) . vanilla . simple . *** quite acidic , some fruit . a solid *** corked . not rated simple cherry fruit and acidity . rustic at the end . *** sweet maturity . at peak . a top *** very slight almost unnoticeable spritz , but otherwise mature and together and pleasant drinking . a top *** young and closed , but seemed a bit simple . ** ( * ) on the whole , well made stuff , but there does seem to be an odd dull metallic note to the wine . otherwise there is soft , well-balanced fruit . ** a good , fruity , balanced drink . pleasant food or quaffing wine . *** the usual penfold 's style - well made , and with a touch of volatility helping with the balance . *** dry , clean , nice piney ( is that allowed ? ) spicy perhaps is better . reasonable complexity once it has warmed up above the icy temperature at which it was served . decent length . top ** nice white-pepper spicyness - balanced and long - the extreme nature of the vintage less apparent than i feared . ** ( * ) honied - interesting green-tinged high-toned fruit . bone-dry and rather nice . time to drink though . bare *** fresh , grassy , a bit vegetal . fruity and a touch sweet . top * drier , quite intense . hints at almonds and lime . ** slightly corked . not rated a touch reductive/sulphury . forward fruit - pleasantly dry . top ** nice intensity . aniseed . fades a touch . good value . *** a touch of ginger . rounded fruit like a top-class macon . nice intensity and clean , pretty dry palate . very good . *** ( * ) intense pure cassis , ripe with some quite dry succulent tannins . fairly sweet impression on the palate . ** sickly toffee-fudge nose . sweet fruit . i do n't like this . * sweet soft-drink fruit . it expands a bit but i still find it too soft . for somebody who likes the style : *** very sweet , some mushroomyness but so sickly - might almost be a desert wine . i really do n't want to drink this . i ca n't even bring myself to give it stars on an `` if you like this sort of thing '' basis . no stars quite sweet - very soft fruit . herby and lifted . decent * still a bit soft for my palate - has mt e always been this easy ? certainly the best of the three . bare *** almost madeira-like . it suffered a bit on serving - it was rather sedimenty . pleasant but fading a bit . ** almost dry - nice , but no better than it should be given the reputation of the vintage . *** very classic cedary , mature claret nose . classic on the palate too , but there is an air of living dangerously , of corruption , and a general hint that the wine will crack up . really needs food now and probably should be drunk in the next year or two . *** classic again on the nose , but a rather fresher , more stable palate with complex multi-faceted fruit . once open for an hour or so it becomes fragrant and high-toned . drinking well and no hurry to consume . **** this was one of three chapel down wines ( and a few refreshing and pleasing bottled beers ) supplied by the winery . i do n't get to try an awful lot of bacchus nowadays , although way back i used to attend the english wine fair and try samples there . i ca n't say i miss it much . this wine is floral , grapefruity and with hints of sauvignon-like flavours . strangely for a cleanly made 11 % white wine , it is n't the sort of stuff you want to drink a whole bottle of - it 's not unpleasant , just that the acidity and fruit somehow manage to dull the tastebuds . hopefully the champagne style pinot that was also sent will be more interesting . * does wine travel well ? this champagne seems to have . packing the car recently , i opened up one of the underfoot storage compartments to pack a bottle of fizz when i found - to my surprise - a bottle already in there . this , i worked out , had been in the car for the last couple of months ( going everywhere the car went - a thousand miles or so - in the cold and in the warm ) . unfortunately i did n't have another , untravelled bottle of this around for comparsion . lovely fizz , with good nutty steely age on the palate . fine depth of flavour , although the palate does tire very slightly at the end . really on very good form . **** good fruit and depth of colour . very obvious new oak on the palate . good drinkable modern wine . *** fragrant , dry palate , quite meaty and serious . time to drink i guess - it will never be soft and the fruit is fully mature . rather enjoyable . *** i do n't often drink village chablis . this is a good example of what you get from a good one : all the stony minerality and dryness of a premier cru but just a bit less intense and refined . best with food . ** seems a bit thin and mean straight from cellar , but when it warms up its fantastic : dry and succulent but with intense strawberry fruit and a bit of beetroot in the mouth . quite structured - it will probably improve a bit yet . am i being overgenerous with *** ( * ) quite tight and lean , i wondered a bit whether it was n't a little thin when judged by the highest standards , but while not an absolute star , more and more emerged with some breathing . very well-defined hazelnut fruit and taut acidity . excellent wine with no sign of the problems that plague some wines in this vintage . top *** lovely bright , crisp red fruits . excellent concentration and balance , great fruit but bone dry . just a lovely village wine , i thought at first - but after some time to breath it seemed to have complexity and interest beyond that . top *** top , top quality . creamy fruit , lean , complex and mineral - with only a slightly reduced intensity and length reflecting the modest vintage . **** very good village wine - good fruit and the fine acidity of the vintage . delicious . a good *** quite rich , forward , exotic fruit . drinking nicely . this bottle had been forgotten in a freezer overnight , and then thawed - did n't seem to have done much damage , and as my host remarked it 's an easy way of opening the bottle . ** pure , quite mineral , the fact that this is a `` no new oak '' wine very pleasingly evident . quite a lot of richness to the fruit too , specially once it had been open for half an hour . could probably do with a couple of years and might age well for longer . nice wine . bare *** understated , quite complex , but a little flat and dominated by a caramel/toffee overlay that i 'm not keen on . being a tempier fan i was expecting a lot from this , but on this showing i 'm not wildly keen . ** dull , very deep-coloured and tending to oxidation . nothing like a couple of other halves of this from the same lot which were lovely . an early case of `` poxy white burgundy '' or just a dodgy cork ? not rated attractive and drinkable , but lacking the mineral complexity of the launois nv drunk recently . *** pleasant mature rieslong - needing drinking fairly soon . bare *** writing up my notes from visiting d-j in rully persuaded me to open this , brought back from their cellars . bright , attractive and authentic , but lacking any special buzz . i wrote that on initially drinking a glass or two : returning the following night this has opened out and is showing lovely minerality . scrapes *** ( * ) from a magnum ( well it was new year 's eve ) . i think i 've had this bottle for five plus years . lovely stuff - beautifully balanced . could still have used a few more years . a very easy **** deep colour , very yeasty nose and honied appley fruit with bags of mushrooms . evolved . quite bold and rich . long and delicious , provided you like the meaty , not so elegant , bollinger style - it 's not everyones glass of bubbles . top **** quite elegant but rich ( some botrytis perhaps ) . very fine . *** ( * ) mineral , nice fruit , dry and taught . starting to drink nicely . bare **** deep colour , rather lovely , gentle , long , mellow , nutty and delightful . some say a little lacking poise or complexity but i quite like it . *** pure , quite light and aetherial ( the vineyard perhaps ) . nice length and texture . pleasingly little oak . still improving but may be wo n't merit another star . pretty good . *** dusty , quite large but dry . tending towards baked ( typical of the vintage ) - a little chunky . still pretty good . quite a clarety style of burgundy . bare *** ( * ) closed at first , but opens out - lovely pure raspberry fruit . high-toned . very long . needs a few more years to peak . **** ( * ) dry , nice , savoury , but time to drink . top *** colour tending to brown . quite animal , rich and decadent - fades a bit in the glass and rapidly becomes cloying . ** amazing dense young colour . floral , mineral , tobacco . iodine finish . very fine indeed . ***** mineral nose , rich cherry fruit hot iron finish . fantastic interest - packed with ripe tannins . great balance - but lots of potential . top **** ( * ) very easy , silky , forward . touch of class . i would like to try this from a stronger vintage and with a bit of age . *** apricot fruit , creamy texture and flavour . no great complexity ( typical of eiswein ) . lovely acidity . bare **** as it opens up , rather fine - raspberry fruit , touch of chocolate , a bit spirity towards the end . moderate weight now . top **** very fresh , lots of fizz . touch of yeast , etc - a touch shorter and less weighty than the bolly . in spectacularly good condition and with fine , precise bready flavours . lovely top **** from a half . its usual reliable self - fine bubbles and good medium-weight balance . *** from a half . simple and charming . i love claret like this , especially when the purpose of the evening is purely social rather than wine related . this is at peak and a pleasure to drink . *** ok stuff with decent fruit . a touch coarse . ** beautiful . especially after a bottle of indifferent prosecco drunk with candied ( ? ) hibiscus flowers in the glass . the lynch-bages is elegant , and suggests an inner depth that is not at present fully forthcoming . hints of peach kernel and tempered steel . **** poor alongside the lynch-bages . too soft and undemanding . *** this needs a bit more time . good structure and supple tannins - medium length . a good *** brought round by a friend for a sunday lunch . a slight whiff of the farmyard when first opened , but this cleared to reveal a light-to-medium weight claret with classic cigar box . *** rich vanilla fruit , excellent concentration . not the last word in elegance and the mousse is a bit coarse - but overall a splendid wine . at least a good *** ( * ) fruitcakey claret , quite big and robust - seems a little woody at first but returning a day later it 's clean , nicely-toned mature wine . chunky and in the final analysis not that complex , but good . *** vanillan , lovely mousse , very elegant . understated class . **** rich , good riesling character , quite a lot of residual sugar . good in its way . *** lovely fresh fruit . complex , delicate nose . falls off a bit in the mouth . opens out with some air and holds up well on returning after the other wines . this is one of their lesser wines - it 's a credit to the property . *** rich , lively , smoky , very nice . less fine than the cubillo but richer . ( from a half . ) *** inky , tannic , plummy , a bit baked . lovely secondary characters merging . *** ( ** ) suaver , rounder , suggestive of pomerol . pure and a touch higher-toned than the barton . not ready but a bit shorter-term too . top *** ( * ) terribly refined , mature claret . great breed and balance . i sometimes find pichon just a little too suave and lacking edge for my tastes , but this is a super wine . **** nice old nose . a touch of tea - good but does n't develop on the palate . creamy vanilla . just a bit rubbery but that becomes less noticeable as it opens in the glass . *** gamy , mineral yet edgy and unbalanced . interesting yet also slightly flawed . possibly a dodgy bottle . top *** rich , limey fruit . young-seeming . apple finish . excellent - marred ever so slightly by a raw woody background . top *** a touch pruney and hard - opens up a bit but remains a bit unsatifyingly remote . i would expect more . *** fresh , fragrant raspberry nose . fine , elegany , light palate . joyfully lovely . ***** elegant as always , silky-testured drinking wine . but i do n't feel this has the power for long-term evolution that ( say ) the 1990 has . drinking nicely now . top *** drinking ( from a half ) really beautifully now . a delight . **** i recall being a bit disappointed last time i drank one of these magnums . this one however is delightful , mature , berryish st emilion . breed and balance to the fore . very good drinking . top *** initially modern , rich , almost flashy . later , gamy . not sure what to make of this - it 's not like the vallana wines of old but it is quite substantial . top ** pure , luscious . not really a keeper on this showing . top *** funky , showing age , substantial but odd . *** nicely integrated , a touch sweet and easy perhaps but high quality . top *** fragrant nose with a tar underlay . high-toned , pure yet quite gutsy tannins too . persistent on the finish with chocolatey notes . it 's pretty tightly wound still and a bit enigmatic . my guess is a bare *** ( * ) clean , dry , attractive . very drinkable . ** very pure , high-toned yet silky fruit . somewhat in the burgundian style but with roses , tar and chocolate and noticable but ripe nebbiolo tannins . on the other hand it has that floral scentedness of proper old-fashioned bordeaux . doubtless worth keeping a few years but it is so well-made it is a pleasure to drink now . top *** perhaps starting to tire a bit nice fruit , quite dry-seeming now with a bit of pfalzy weight and a hint of hardness . pleasant enough . ** yeasty , quite meaty . rich . needs a few years . i have n't had a recently purchased bottle of pol for a while and was surprised by its weight . good though . *** lovely sous-bois and blackberry nose , silky fruit , ripe ( in the modern style ) with succulent , tannins . rather classy in a fairly modern way . ( a quick thrash ongoogle reveals this one some sort of iwc trophy - i can understand that . ) not entirely my sort of thing but still perhaps worth a bare *** ( * ) iodine and iron , rich , decadent , fleshy . fruitcake fruit . good , and time to drink . bare **** tight acidity , fine and intense . i 've been a bit up-and-down about this wine but i 'm sure i like this bottle . perhaps even **** quite big , a touch flabby , rather evolved and vegetal . i 'm not sure what combination of producer , vintage and possibly premature oxidation accounts for this , being unfamiliar with the first two factors in this case . still pretty drinkable . bare *** lightweight , feminine and fragrant although with quite a hard core running through it that suggests drinking with food . modest acidity , and so i am not sure how long this is for keeping . very pleasant but without real distinction at the highest level . top *** not very striking . ** herby nose , quite tight and nicely balanced for the vintage . *** juicy , succulent , a touch of minerality . very good : drinking but will probably improve a bit yet . *** an attractive combionation of piquant high-toned fruit with a lovely rounded ripeness . very good - for drinking over the next few years , i think . top *** ( domaine de la bon gran ) rather rich , touch of botrytis probably , pretty good . *** really nice - quite forward as the producers wines tend to be , quite big but in balance . no hint of the problems of the vintage . top *** the second bottle of h. lignier 1er cru from this vintage i have tried recently . this is so pure , digestible and generally fine , but understated - it does n't shout and it does n't have a particular note of individuality for me . yet it is a complete wine that i like a lot . beginning to drink well , but not a long-haul wine . top *** notably off-dry still , very fresh with rounded , attractive fruit . good . *** lovely apple and cream nose , slightly honied and a touch of yeast . fine mousse too . lovely . a 93/94/95 blend i believe . top **** that old rioja nose of nuts and mushrooms and something slightly medical - lovely . very fresh , nicely rounded fruit . ultimately i suppose not complex enough to be a great wine but rather good . bare **** good intensity , the fruit has a distinct character : mineral , not fruit-driven , something almost secondary about what is surely primary fruit . very engaging . top *** very gentle , completely resolved , pleasantly enjoyable . *** all very lovely , but despite the deftness of the touch of new barriques , i feel it lacks the crystaline purity of his other wines . *** an enigma : that slightly `` flat '' souuthern-french palate , but with air an engaging herby nose . is it going anywhere ? i 'm not sure . top ** lovely cherry fruit . very attractive . *** good syrah character , fruit-driven but not to the point of undrinkability . pleasant . scrapes ** substantial and weighty , notable botrytis , interesting palate but perhaps tending towards rustic . this was just a taste -i 'd be interested to try more . *** fruit still has a lot of primary blackcurrant but the structure seems resolved so i guess this is for drinking now . creamy , some cigar-box , all in all attractive fruit , but a little too undemanding to rate a really high score . top *** i guess i could get used to this trocken business : this has good fruit and is bone-dry without being harsh . still fairly moderate alcohol at 12 % , the overall balance is good . a year or two short of its peak , i suspect . *** blackberry fruit , some oak i think - quite tannic perhaps from the oak . modern-style . ** an interesting expression of the langhe , if with a modern tinge of new oak . everything conterno makes iselegan and drinkable and this is no exception . on the other hand i ca n't feel it is ultimately distinguished in the way that his barolos are . a mix of four grape varietoes including nebbiolo . bare *** round berry fruit , quite a lot of blackcurrant , some tobacco . very nice mature claret , if tending slightly towards the rustic - lacks the fineness of a top wine . good though . *** quite spritzy initially but the next day that had dissipated and the honeysuckle soave charcter and pure fruit very evident . good length too . top ** ( * ) this is better every time i try it - class will out and i think it is le mesnil fruit that is giving it such minerality and complexity . delicious . **** my last bottle of this . it 's really a relaxed , fully mature , attractive and balanced wine . enough complexity to be interesting and the primary fruit that i remember being rather excessive years ago is now nicely in balance . very good . i notice in passing that it is a relativel modest 12.5 % alcohol . *** very classy , pure , blackberry and apple fruit . demanding but ripe tannins , very succulent . really good dolcetto . *** spritzy from dissolved co2 i guess . excellent richness of fruit , intensity and length . nice sweetness balanced by really good acidity . at least *** ( * ) lovely bright appetising mosel wine , yet with a rich fruitiness . very attractive . top *** the second time i 've tried this recently . it 's an ozzie-like cabernet syrah blend but with a very unozzie dry palate . seems to get better the longer it is open . fine wine . *** a dry dark oloroso-like palate - what a p.c . ought to have i guess but i often find them more amontillado there too as well as on the nose . rather good . 15 years old according to their web site . top *** spicy riesling petrolly nose . pretty dry - good length . but fairly simple and light . * again petrolly - rather richer . quite good concentration . dry . i wonder how this will go given it is already so petrolly . ** honey and caramel . butter . less intense on the palate . good ** less ambitious and benefits from that - in fact reasonably concentrated and intense . *** unusually intense vanilla nose . damp straw - quite heavy-textured . ** honied and rich . charred nose and oily fruit . big and long . impressive in its way ( which is not my way ) . bare *** berry nose . oddly rasping finish . ** minty . similar - finishes a bit abruptly . ** minty . a bit toffeed . high-toned . i 'm not wild about this . ** liquor blackberries . medium-weight palate - oddly bitter finish . might be going to be rather good . ( i keep getting this wine in situations where i ca n't sit back , drink a couple of glasses and think about it . i must try and do that at some point . ) *** dry , pure , well-made . balanced . *** liquour raspberry again . a bit thick . softer and lacking the attack of the 2001 . ** hints at mint again . oddly twisty . yet more balanced than the chileans . ** quite fresh , fruity , straw-like . high-toned . rather nice . *** pleasant and gracefully old - perhaps going a bit flat . top ** i spent the day moving paving slabs ( heavy and intense ) and making fish stock ( light and intense ) . the stock was poured over some cod , sea bass , spinach and creme fraiche ( this is n't fine wine dairy , but it does pay to get decent creme fraiche ) and then baked in the oven with a little grated parmesan . stroganoff , excellent cheeses from the cambridge cheese company and a passion fruit tart from maison blanc in oxford ( that my daughter was very passionate about ) followed . good fizz which is perhaps just beginning to tire . medium weight and with a hint of oxidation . top *** rather simple after the de venoge - lighter weight . some complexity emerges after a while in the glass . *** this was the sort of bottle you would avoid even on the most generous of bin-end offers : the label stained and some evidence that the wine was seeping through the cork and dribbling down the capsule . however , the wine inside was lovely . this was as tight a riesling as you could hope to taste with classic minerality and finely tuned acidity . a really fine effort with time ahead . *** ( * ) one of those wines where the first sniff tells you that you are in the presence of something special . glorious sweet st julien fruit with a palate that is on first taste deceptively simple . none of the â\\x91typical talbot whiff of the barnyard ' that broadbent notes , but rather , on this showing , a wine of great purity and lasting structure . superb , and at a glorious peak . ***** from magnum . i guess this was always going to be a come down after the previous wine ( i rather naughtily tasted them in this order when others at the table were more conventional in their drinking order ) . this is reliable stuff that is drinking well with its tarry , coffee and chocolate overtones . good claret that , enjoyable though it is ( i am drinking it whilst typing these notes ) , gets relegated , for now , to the luncheon division . a good *** from a half . delicious and aging rather well . good apricoty acidity and with a sweetness that is verging on being oversweet , but which is contained within the framework of the wine . i think this will age into something truly great . **** ( * ) showing its age with a tendency towards maderisation but very drinkable with yeasty rich fruit and good length . **** like a viognier almost , nicely intense . top ** pure black-cherry fruit in profusion . good concentration and so on , with a slightly cassis character that seems quite common in modern wines . how will this age i wonder ? probably quite well although the whole package is a bit soft for my taste . top *** fragrant , lightweight ( a very poor vintage of course ) , no very great length , needs drinking soon but it still has lovely minerality and is very stylish . top *** meatier , longer and generally a bit more substantial than the 93 with a slight bitterness on the finish that will probably ease further although the wine must be close to peak . again so individual and so much a terroir wine . i love it . bare **** backward , dense but fragrant and long . coming towards peak . really lovely . **** ( * ) this has rather a baked fruit character that i am not so keen on . it is hard to taste against great wines like the gentaz , but only a top ** fragrant , dry and long . more mineral and complex than the other ogier wines . really lovely and should be drunk on its own away from the gentaz wines that tend to upstage it . **** an absolute star that could even benefit from another year or two . tremendous weight , and concentrated minerality but all in balance . fantastic . top ***** needs a swirl or two in the glass but characteristic cote rotie violets emerge . very good . top *** this has a solid core of fruit , and the minerality and complexity that all the wines possess . it is a touch harder and a touch less strong all round than the 89 however . bare ***** fragrant , balanced , easy-going wine with a nice dry finish . good *** corked . not rated awkwardly dry and rather short . would go down quite well with food perhaps but not great - hardly surprising given the vintage . top ** asian spices ( as r.p . so often says ) . fresh ( almost youthful still ) with fantastically long fruit . gorgeous . top ***** oxidised - might be an odd bottle so i wo n't rate it but of course at this age from this vintage they might all be this way . not rated more awkward than the 85 - it lacks that wines easy balance . but this is really complex and the minerality is perhaps even more pronounced . intellectual wine and really good . ***** more open and leafy , lacks the poise of the best vintages but does give a long mineral mouthful . **** top stuff but a little flabby and keroseney for a special cuvee from this producer . top *** mineral , broad , intense with a restrained , crystalline purity . brilliant . ***** pale tangerine colour in a decanter . intensely gingery on the nose ( as ramonet 's wines often are ) but to a grotesque degree . rather horrible palate - probably just oxidised but in a rather odd way . a day later the oxidation aspect less apparent but still extravagently gingery and with a dull flatness . no stars much more what one expects - plenty of acid , quite juicy , nice fruit . *** quite leafy liquid tobacco . this seems to have gone backwards a bit since i last tasted it - clearly needs a few years but good drinking now too . *** ( * ) according to the front label 'an original blend of 95 % syrah ' ; according to the back label a 'wonderful accompaniment to chicken dishes , goat 's cheese tart or full flavoured cheeses ' and 'suitable for vegetarians and vegans ' . unlike the labelling , the wine is n't too contrived . good balance and good red fruit depth . it will probably improve with a few years age . by the way , the other 5 % is mouvedre [ sic ] . just ** ( * ) i was n't expecting much of this - sunday evening combined with a general foreboding about white rhones . what a revelation though ! glorious full bodied stuff with a lovely toffee and honeysuckle length to the palate . a wine i could drink and drink - and not just on sundays . **** good old fizz with touches of honey , wood and aniseed . medium bodied and with the acidity to keep the mature flavours together . **** a disappointing wine in some sense . quite winey , and does n't really have the class one expects . relatively ( for a big name from '96 ) rather simple and lacking the drama and complexity of something to tuck away for the future . possibly an off form bottle . ** ( * ) exotic , rich , old-fashioned . splendid . *** peachy , exotic , quite evolved . made to drink fairly young , but has that grand cru something about it . bare **** so floral , pure and beautiful . intense , dry . approachable but lots of underlying structure . completely gorgeous . ***** ( * ) mineral , very attractive , drinking nicely . *** rounder and a bit more concentrated . mineral finish . very good . still fairly young . *** ( * ) much more reserved . dense . very concentrated - more balanced than the 90 . brilliant . *** ( ** ) leaner , sea breezes . very classic . lovely . ( in time the 89 will be the better wine i guess . ) **** ( * ) lighter nose . edgy finish . not a bad 78 . *** not edgy like the last time . very fine . piquant . complex . very classic . ***** thanks to everybody for bringing interesting and enjoyable wines , and to centotre for feeding us well . dry , rich , appetising . long . pretty nice . i feel a bit of barrique aging is aiming at an international market , but it is good . i 'd like to sit down and drink a few glasses one evening . maybe even scrapes *** quite burgundian weight . oaky ( but quite well handled ) chardonnay . classy - needs time though . i find the tunina a bit more individual but this is pretty good . bare *** ( * ) as usual , a melange of flavours . delicious . bare **** turkish delight . dry . could be a bit tiring although perhaps gewurz is ever that way . nice balance of rose-scented fruit with a dry palate . good length . another wine i'dlike to try `` properly '' . a good *** big-scaled wine - top chianti as i 'd expect from this wine in such a fine vintage . bare *** ( * ) stinky at first - blows off to reveal a really good taught , balanced wine . rather good , i think . bare *** ( * ) herby . good balance . very drinkable . *** suave , silky , dry . quite structured . easy ** ( * ) a bit dry - might improve but seems a bit austere . but rather a nice nose . ** ( * ) scented nose but tannic . serious , i find the new oak tannins a bit more difficult young than the traditional style . but the oak is done well and terroir shows through . pretty concentrated - fine wine . this has quite a lot of quality and might evolve well in a sandrone sort of way . ** ( ** ) light elegant , quite fine . i feel i 've had slightly better bottles of this . top *** more body but perhaps a touch less well delineated than the sandrone . very nice approaching maturity . bare **** so delicate , mineral , fine and long . just ready . ***** a bit extracted and a bitter for my palate . not my sort of thing , although there 's alot of wine in the glass . perhaps i might warm to it with more time . good ** dry , savoury , cooked fruits . mushrooms , nuts . really good amarone . maybe even *** ( * ) nice way to finish - well-balanced and delicious . top *** dry , juicy , mineral , nicely made . a bit thin on the mid-palate initially but it fills out with time . nice . bare *** ( * ) a bit more modern-styled . pleasantly creamy . *** good farmyardy , mature burgundy - quite piquant and perhaps a touch rough with marked tannins . nice drinking but fades a little in the glass . *** rather dilute , dull and uninteresting . * past it - horrible . no stars a bit tough and tannic , but with good texture . could do with a bit more fruit . more drinkable than i thought it would be . ** not a star village , an un-rated vineyard and a moderate vintage - it 's amazing what sensitive winemaking can achieve . lovely , drinkable , engaging , characterful and not entirely simple fuit - nine years old and about at peak from a half . really very enjoyable . *** dense colour . quite syrah-like at first , but more baked ( almost burnt ) plum fruit after a while . good texture - feels nice in the mouth . good structure too - this is a rather good , characterful wine . still improving and needing time , but perhaps it wo n't actually quite rate more stars . *** really quite youthful still , high-toned food wine with a touch of ( very italian ) bitterness . nice fruit . i described this as `` modern '' last time i drank it , but it is n't evolving quickly . merits *** a big hit of blackcurrant on the nose initially - and a while after it still has quite a lot of forward fruit , at least compared to the more austere higher-toned 94 . still a fine wine but i 'm having trouble getting to grips with it . say , *** lovely high-toned brambly fruit with a touch of cranberry . good ripeness and succulent tannins , nice mineral base too - probably still improving and could even rate another star in time . for now a top *** my last bottle of this : rich and flavoursome with highly evolved fruit - on my first sip i thought it was past its best , but on longer acquaintance i felt it was about at its best while needing drinking relatively soon . top *** healthy colour - cedary , fruitcake nose and a pleasantly balanced palate . pretty much at peak , but holding nicely - a bit of air and it opens up and reveals a fragrant side too . i have n't always been overwhelmed by the wines from this estate , but this has shifted my opinion up a bit . *** very pleasantly cedary , but this bordeaux-style wine 's fruit is becoming a bit thin now . ** my last bottle of this : lemony vanilla , touch of sherry character but completely and enjoyably fresh and appetising . almost timeless , but i guess it would n't improve . very pleasant mature wine ( of an unfashionable sort ) . *** scented , dry and savoury - old-fashioned claret that is n't that weighty . very pleasant , but i think perhaps not one of the best wines from this property - it is still improving but may not rate more stars . *** i have n't tasted this for eight years , i think . i rated it very highly then as a young wine and now it has a restrained but lovely old apricot nose and a wonderful density of fruit of fruit and a rich , extravagently viscous texture . there 's a nice level of acidity too that stops it cloying and a very long finish . very lovely , but i have slight reservations about the complexity - it does seem , as one might perhaps expect from the grape , a touch one-dimensional given its other qualities . **** my first sampling of jadot 's beaujolais project . my first thought was that i was expecting something a bit larger , but the fruit has good , under-stated concentration and there is an attractive mineral core too . very drinkable , yet there is a tannic underpinning that will give a at least a few years of positive evolution . i am quite positive about htis - for now a conservative ** ( * ) lovely , intense , grenache-based wine - long , balanced , like a very good chateauneuf . easy top *** the lamaione is a disappointing wine . i remember having it for the fist time ( before fwd , in 1995 or earlier i guess ) . then it oozed class , and in 1997 i still rated it highly . but since then it has declined , and now one word will do : 'undrinkable ' - although i 've expanded slightly beyond that below . i wonder whether its earlier showing was flattered by some flashy wine making ( carb . mac. ? ) . there are n't many wines i 've poured down the sink , but this was one of them . harsh and astringent . completely gone . no stars i do n't want to be unfair to this wine ( it was a quick replacement for the undrinkable lamaione ) , but this is n't quite of the standard that previous vintages of this wine used to be - although , possibly , it is just a bit closed . * a really good bottle of this wine - it seems in the past to have varied between 3 and 4 stars . this one had the good strawberry leather nose of the best bottles . **** leathery , rustic and farmyardy . not the most elagent wine ever , but it never has been . just **** touch of toast , nice middle of the road champagne palate , medium weight , decent finish . *** quite vinous nose . chewy palate with some obvious wood influence . good length . top *** elegant , ripe apples , fine , long finish . excellent fine mousse . not universally enjoyed , perhpas becaus it could do with some time in bottle . i like the style though . scrapes **** seems good but very slightly tainted - corked maybe , but perhaps in fact excess sulphur . takes the edge off . not rated dry , fragrant , nice balance . *** very toasty - one gets used to it . very tightly elegant and fine but it lacks sensory oomph a bit even though it is seriously concentrated . loses fizz quite quickly . i have slightly mixed feelings about this but maybe it needs further study . top **** quite full-bodied - a touch rustic perhaps . there is something of macon-with-bubbles about it but nevertheless it 's very drinkable . good *** some lovely wine , but also some disappointments . i 've had talbot , gruaud larose and las cases 1982 in the last few months , and whilst the first two have been stunning ; the last one is not showing well . lovely together fizz - good acidity - elegant . **** delicious weighty wine with a good , heavy acidity . stunning . ***** lovely riesling nose - elegant palate - acidity variable , but the wine is n't getting flabby . *** good wine with food ( garlic and chilli prawns ) , but a bit simple . *** dry finish - unknit - not really clear whether it has a direction . *** dusty and drying out . ** good but closed . ** ( * ) drinking beautifully . easily the claret of the evening for drinking now . textbook pauillac at a peak . **** disappointing . a touch volatile at the end . weighty , but it should be better than this . *** good wine which others preferred more than me . big and balanced . *** from a half . good botrytis , but the acidity is lacking . too heavily sweet for my tastes . *** the last time i had this , in 2002 , it seemed a weedy wine that probably was n't going to live to its youthful potential . it just had the odd glimpse suggesting it might improve - but i was n't that convinced . fortunately though , this bottle at least is on lovely form . a dry wine without flashiness , but lovely toned acidity and flavours that are constantly developing in the glass . and to think that i almost decided to drink all my bottles in 2002 . an easy **** holding up well , but so dull compared with the chateauneuf above . simple sweet flavours . i suppose *** attractive nutty ( marzipan ? ) , tangy nose , very nicely-textured palate with solid underlying fruit and a lovely salty finish . all quite refined . maybe scrapes **** not what i expected on opening , oddly rounded fruit and a tired feeling . after a while though it opens up quite nicely : bone-dry , savoury , citric , a touch of herbs and a hint of fino sherry . very nice and perhaps will even improve . for now *** very luxurious agreeable oloroso that slips down a treat without generating the last word in excitement although its nose is pretty complex at least soon after opening . say *** this wine has a touch of the lifted salty tang of manzanilla over a burnt old-wine palate with a long finish . very mouthwatering , a touch of camphor or something . seems almost better after a day or two open . very lovely . easy **** very fine and long - tangy , hints of chocolate almost on the nose . not quite as demanding as the coliseo from this house but very fine . **** very drinkabe old sherry , grippy and with that nice hint of sourness . not the last word in fineness however - i feel this hints a bit at dry-cleaning fluid . *** rich and long with rather greater depth than a standard fino - salty tang too , nice acidity and a long , citric finish . very clean and pure . *** not quite one thing or the other if you know what i mean . vibrant ripe fruit to start with but with a green and dilute finish . not as interesting as i would have hoped . ** good fruit but perhaps a touch rustic - old straw farmyard characters of a pleasant sort . completely mature and very drinkable . forgiving it a certain rusticity one might stretch to **** warm and ripe ( the vintage i guess ) but perhaps beginning to lose it in a graceful way . cedary but not terribly complex . bare *** seems pretty much ready to drink - nice balance , generous fruit and a nice dry finish . bare **** lovely appetising , drinkable wine ( breaking for another mouthful as i type ) . not a hint of the varietal flab , yet lovely ripe fruit and mineral overtones . something of almonds about the whole package too . this has the balance to keep well for a while i feel , and it may even improve over a year or so . dry yet not austere , and with really good length . classy . *** clean , fresh and simple wine with lightweight raspberry fruit . ** a touch oxidised , but i could n't decide whether this was the winemaking or a duff bottle . so , until i get to try it again not rated from a magnum . good sweet fruit , chocolate and coffee . good balance for drinking now . top *** bone dry and with good intensity and length . it just seems to lack a bit of pizzaz - the whole effect is a touch ( but just a touch ) flat . *** silky-textured and rich , one feels this wine is part of the transition to a modern style here . but this has produced a fine wine in this vintage , voluptuous , but still with enough stuffing . *** nice mature riesling nose - completely resolved and really quite soft and lovable . top *** i have mixed feelings about this : on the plus side , fine nettle-like fruit , nicely balanced , now mature with a decent finish and a streak of minerality ; on the minus side a slight lack of real presence , just a little underwhelming considering the reputation of the producer . scrapes *** it 's easy to scoff at musar , and until today i had n't opened one of my own bottles for a year or two , but it 's really not half bad you know . rustic , yes - ultimately fairly simple , yes - but it does have lovely round , sweet , leathery fruit and it has aged very gracefully to a soft , amber-edged maturity . so it 's easy to scoff in the other sense too . *** some will say this is past its peak but i rather like it . mature riesling apricot flavours , old wine roundedness , very pleasant . *** quite big , ripe and sweet for spatlese . very attractive , quite forward and engaging fruit . very good rather than really riveting . top *** quite big , ripe and rich . this has a timeless quality - while showing some mature characters it is still quite sweet and very fresh - it will benefit from more time in bottle i think and will probably merit 4 stars in the long run . impressive . *** ( * ) remeniscent of a top rhone grenache : high-toned , a touch medicinal . this is really good wine - intense fruit but a nice balance . top *** this has now opened up nicely - gorgeous long , mouthfilling greengage fruit . it was so tight a few years ago and it has been fascinating to watch its progress . it is bone dry and has that wachau sternness that ( slightly to my surprise ) i am often a bit ambivalent about . this though is drinking so nicely - perhaps it 's just a mistage to try and drink these wines young . very top *** this seems to have become a touch more piquant and high-toned than i recall . a grown-up 's wine with tanins that might never be entirely mellow until too late , and a classic claret nose . lovely . top *** sherberty , very open fruit , and very pleasantly drinkable at 8 % alcohol . a bit spritzy at first and ever so slightly hollow on the palate , if i was going to criticise . on the other hand , it has a lovely long finish . ready to drink i guess , but no great hurry . lovely . top *** raspberry fruit , nodding at cassis also , dry , very firm as this producers wines tend to be - still a touch hard . very nice village wine coming round as it approaches its 10th birthday . *** rather nice - intense grapefruity riesling , with something towards nectarine on a persistant finish . seems quite dry to me for a classic-style rheingau but that may partly be the particularly good acidity . drinking nicely but no hurry to consume - might even be better in a few years . top *** a high-toned wine from this most european-styled of californian winemakers , with rich yet piquant fruit . this will improve a bit i suspect but needs the right food . bare *** seven year-old soave ? the fruit is now rather evolved - peach kernels and almonds , but still fresh and with a hint of floral notes on the nose . some will say this is past its best but i like it a lot . dry , attractive , drinkable . a good *** dry , yet with with very nicely-textured fruit . a bargain at well the right side of a tenner . ** pleasant . ** nice example , without any great extra complexity . top ** red burgundy wine as it helpfully says on the label . rather dilute and lacking . possibly just too old . * sweeter fruit than the above , and with a simple charm . but hard work finding much flavour . ** a bit unripe on the palate , and with coarse fruit . some ( pleasant ) signs of maturity on the nose , but not coordinated with the rest of the wine . ** easily the best of the recent pinots that i 've had . a touch stewed , but at least not suffering the dilute characters of the two french wines . *** medium depth , well put together for early drinking . reasonably taut . *** liquorice and black cherry nose . charming for early drinking . *** occasional glimpses of bacon fat and raspberry , but some coarseness and awkwardness . ** a slight spritz on opening . lihtly honeyed and with hints of blanched almonds . *** sherberty rich , drinking very nicely as it has for a while and will for a few years yet . long and delicious . top *** rounded , forward fruit - pleasant but ultimately fairly simple . bare *** rather overwrought - huge alcohol - rather flabby fruit ( although superficially there 's decent acidity ) . a substantial wine that perhaps i just was n't in the mood for . top ** gamy , rustic , high-quality fruit . interesting , quite complex , characterful . guessed this might be swan . top *** good fruit . nicely balanced . good concentration . good *** baked , tarry fruit . very tannic - serious ( perhaps overly so ) . others will admire this more than me . *** jammy , solid , quite raisiny . very substantial wine - i find it a touch heavy going at the moment . i suspect it will improve and be rather impressive . *** ( * ) refined , concentrated , almost high-toned . just beginning to drink well . lovely . **** nice - similar in style but a shade weaker all round . good *** very dark colour . very marmaladey . ultimately not so complex and clearly upstaged by the filhot . *** light colour but in fact quite botrytised . quite high-toned . grippy . a very good wine for the property . **** very pruney and rich . really appealing fruit with some hot edges . probably for drinking now , and pretty pleasant in its way . *** a bit drier and more mainstream . still a shade closed , very good . bare *** ( * ) possibly seems a bit older than it is . good acidity and some tannin at the end of a fairly full bodied , old-fashioned entrance . needs some time to resolve itself . **** ( * ) more floral and open than the last bottle i had of this . well made fizz for drinking young . *** fairly vinous and with good , sharply focused acidity at the end . a champagne that tastes like a good young fizzy burgundy . this needs time , and could be stunning . *** ( ** ) possibly not in the best of condition compared with a recent bottle that toby had . the flavours are a bit dull and it is more oxiidative than might be expected . not rated weighty , meaty nose - autolytic plus apples . similarly with the palate , but not at the expense of balance . apples again , a suggestion of tannins . long , quite complex , perhaps a touch young - i 'm sure a year or two in cellar will be beneficial . scrapes *** ( * ) really quite forward - touch of vanilla - long and enjoyable but does n't seem to have the guts to be a real keeper . bare **** only a year or two delayed versus the standard vintage . still very fresh , nutty and autolytic - really yeasty on the nose . drier and tighter than the ga 97 too - lower dosage probably and perhaps the vintage too . complex finish . lovely . scrapes ***** red wine made from pinot noir , of course . fairly complex nose , bone dry - seems a bit flat and old on the mid-palate . all the interest is on the nose . rather dull in the mouth . if fizz could be made with these grapes , then this is a bit of a waste except that it gives some insight into the nature of fruit that makes good champagne . bare ** very mushroom and truffle - and hinting at maderisation . curious indeed , and not entirely positively . old beyond its years - is it an odd bottle ? the guy from bollinger says not , but seemed to have decided this before nosing mine . perhaps having this after desert was a poor idea ( i did think of leaving my pud until later ) and i would n't be surprised if there is more to this wine than i found . for now , the interest on the nose scrapes **** lovely delicate summer drinking with almond and white fruit flavours . *** lovely delicate summer drinking with almond and white fruit flavours . *** fragrant , mellow , eminently drinkable . fresh but a suspicion of drying at the end suggests this is not for keeping beyond another five or so years . *** high-toned , a bit of cranberry , a touch of underlying meatiness and excellent fruit . lovely but without the va-va-voom of the combe aux moins from the same producer and vintage tasted recently . still scrapes *** ( * ) lively , quite complex , proper tarry barolo and more or less `` a point '' . a bit coarse-textured to be worth more than *** the things one finds when cataloguing the cellar - an auction purchase of a couple of bottles i seem to recall . i opened one with trepidation but no need : actually a healthy light colour and a lovely , fresh , tar and roses barolo nose . the fruit had that underlying sweetness that good barolo has and which with the fragrance sets off the firmness of even mature tannins . not terribly complex but really very enjoyable drinking . *** i have oscillated a bit about this 100 % gargenega wine . it is ca rugate 's interpretation of what old soave might have been like , i seem to recall . it has a deep colour ( from skin contact , i think ) and a broad , flat , mouthfilling palate after a honeysuckle nose . it reminds me a bit of one or two other italian producers who are pushing things in a similar direction : massa vecchia and gravner . it is rather less grand than either ( and a bit cheaper ) but i like it , and i think time is making it more interesting . *** intense strawberry nose , solid , concentrated fruit , quite dry as often with lafarge . a touch of italianate bitterness and quite firm tannins make it rather a food wine at the moment . i hope that rawness wears off - i think it will . *** ( * ) surprisingly high-toned almost amontillado-like nose . palate has warm raisiny character and a nice texture . *** very pure , raspberry fruit . now completely resolved and drinking very nicely . i think it lacks the real edge of terroir at this stage , or something to add complexity . drinking pretty nicely however . *** smoky raspberry fruit , begining to show its age a bit but still fresh . very drinkable but not super-exciting . *** quite fat and mouthfilling - i have n't drunk this producers wines or chablis from this vintage much so i 'm not sure about the cause of this rather atypical richness . still , this has a lovely honey-influenced palate and enough underlying minerality to be very enjoyable . absolutely at peak . from a half . top *** i seem to remember having mixed feelings about a bottle of this , but this one is lovely - completely drinkable medicinally-edged concentrated grenache . excellent . *** herbs and spices , with rounded green-pea and other vegetal flavours . quite individual but really , really good . **** another 96 from my cellar , opened partly to illuminate the controversy about this vintage . healthy colour , fine fruit , creamy texture and excellent acidity . this seems just a touch subdued right now but is definitely very good . *** ( * ) wine group at m.d . 's flowery , attractive , dry , balanced . bare *** larger , flatter , rich peachy fruit . a touch mmore interesting than the perret wine . a good *** peachy , rich , quite sweet , moderate acidity . bare *** very sugary , rich , sweet . not enough acidity for my palate . ** much better balanced , pleasant . *** fine , tea-nose , lots of acidity . *** leafy , rounded , balnced . very nice . bare **** fragrant , gentle , a bit gamy . pretty good . *** like the beychevelle but a slight twist in the finish . fades in the glass a bit . *** a touch higher-toned . toffeed , quite light . top ** reductive at first - later , fragrant , bone-dry , tarry . proper wine . top *** quite dry now , delicate , peach-kernels . elegant , but perhaps no huge length . bare **** herby brown sugar , fairly simple but a nice balance . bought from a monastry on majorca 20 yrs ago ( ! ) a pretty pleasant drink . ** fading a bit , very evolved , a touch hot . interesting but a bit disappointing . top *** yeasty , nutty , complex , lovely balance . drinking at peak . bare ***** very rich and off-dry for kabinet - a fine vintage , i guess . ** ( * ) a new stylistic experiment , supposedly harking back to an ancient style : quite dry , fantastic length , 12 % alcohol , overall suggestive of austrian riesling . interesting . *** ( * ) very pure and complex , oak not very evident ( an improvement on silex of old ) . excellent concentration . **** excellent - very typically raveneau . **** provence herbs , creamy , lovely . top **** strong nose of apples , flat palate . possibly the wine is just like this but perhaps this is a substandard bottle . not rated gravelly , smoky , excellent . tobacco finish . very pleasantly drinkable . top *** dumb nose and rather volatile palate . not rated beginning to be rather edgy - a bit volatile on the finish . not bad . a good ** rubbery - rather oxidised . * rounded , berryish , touch of raspberry . complex . substantial . very fine . ***** oddly empty midpalate . hard , and difficult , finish . top * fine , picquant , attractive . *** creamy , rich fruit . excellent concentration and length . nice tone . bare **** soft . notable tannins . grand but lacks the shapliness of the last wine . top *** rose petals , fine , nutty , elegant . top **** moderate weight , fragrant , sweet fruit . lively . excellent . **** mature colour and flavour . mineral - i thought st emilion - and now a touch decadent . but a really nice mature claret . bare **** spicy plum fruit-cake - seems quite merlot but that 's probably an illusion . lovely minerality all through . bare *** ( * ) doing well from a half-bottle . fragrant now , quite balanced , some would say a touch past its best but for drining with food i 'm not so sure . very pleasant . *** decent st emilion , if a bit gummy - probably because of oak use . *** healthy colour , attractive mature claret nose . on the palate it has that slightly hollow high-tonedness that seems quite common in the vintage . pleasant , particularly with food . *** gutsy , good fruit . very decent effort . drinking well . *** lovely - for drinking over the next year or three . **** quite advanced , but good . from a half . *** very bright and mouthwatering , pure attractive fruit and some tannic backbone . very good . **** not a flashy , rowdy 82 but i feel perhaps that in avoiding that the wine lacks the definition or complexity to be better than very good . fine wine , starting to drink well , but a little less than one might hope for given the property and the vintage . **** deep browny , slightly green rim . caramely , burnt , quite enjoyable . bare *** deep brown with a green rim . riesling nose . very madeira-like . interesting more than enjoyable , in the end . ** very fine . balanced , starting to drink nicely . top **** rustic , quite exotic . interesting rather than great . top *** lovely , blueberry fruit . refined and pure . good balance for the vintage . ** ( * ) smoke and tobacco , pleasant palate , really nice persistent finish . excellent . bare **** rounder , fruitier , a bit simpler and more rustic . time to drink . *** very fine , elegant , scented , balanced . still on a gentle up-curve . bare ***** sexy , perfumed , a bit showy , very suave , lovely - easier but less intellectually satisfying than the gpl . ***** healthy colour . lovely fragrance , summery , rose-hips . perfumed . lovely . from a half . ***** good colour , chunky , quite tannic . lacks the easy charm of the issan but pretty good . **** grapefruit , kerosene , startling acidity over good fruit . lovely . *** ( * ) plummy , rich fruit - deepening with some air . classy drinking , still quite tannic . bare **** curiously charred and smoky at first but that blows off - presumably not overly toasted barrels then . a lovely , irony mature claret with succulent fruit emerges . delicious drinking . **** fine - elegantly balanced and good length . refined blanc de blancs . could do with a year or so in bottle perhaps but lovely . top *** intense but a bit oaked up at the expense of the clarity that i look for in top soave . clearly a good estate and i 'd be interested to try their unoaked top wines . a good ** a bit unexciting - decent but did n't do a lot for me . * fair acidity - a touch hollow later on the palate . pleasant . bare *** stylish complex nose - hints of ozzy vegetality . only moderately persistent on the finish . quite fine but outrageously overpriced . *** quite rich and sweet - the vintage perhaps . good quality . ** ( * ) soft , forward quite chocolatey st emilion . pleasant drinking . being a bit mean : ** excellent fruit - some structure . serious wine worth another look . ** ( * ) a really good bottle of one of these recently disgorged wines ( that canbe a little variable ) . tjis one with lovely autolytic flavours and honey over lovely fresh fruit . quite nicely rounded , but no hint of flab . ***** quite austere and even a touch awkward right now but with lots of character . perhaps it will be more easy-going in a year or two , but good now with the right food . *** quite forward for maume - the vintage perhaps although the attractive ripe fruit is not at the expense of enough backbone for development for a few tears . really very nice drinking burgundy . *** ( i think i have remembered the vintage correctly . ) nice , well-made dessert wine . ** a welcome 'win ' for a white burgundy , and a good swiss chardonnay . as for the zinfandels , it confirmed my view that i do n't want flashy vibrant stuff - i want something with more complexity along the ridge lines . good if not dramatic fizz . *** nice acidity - honeyed with minor age . lovely texture . **** butter and hazelnuts , but the age is showing possibly a bit more than is ideal . *** soft and dilute . all over the place . ** soft , oldish , touch of sweetness . possibly a bit corked . not rated soft and buttery and a touch of banana . slight spritz . big , but balanced . *** fragrant â\\x91modern ' nose - for early drinking . clean and fresh . *** big , vibrant and zingy , but a bit short . became toffeed in the glass . *** vibrant and in a dry style - needs a bit more time possibly . ** ( * ) more complexity than the others , and to my mind a better style of wine for it - smooth rather than vibrant . a touch of volatility . **** vegetal and astringent - all over the place . i think this wine had a synthetic cork . poor . ** leafy and some tannin . simple and falls apart . ** sweet , but a bit lacking in acidity . some grip . *** corked . not rated opened after the disappointment of the 1999 . also seemed poor , but this was at the end of the evening so i wo n't score , but there was debate about synthetic corks â not rated from a half . not the best example of this . showing too much age and sweetness on this showing . *** yeasty , quite fragrant . slightly toffeed fruit . quite decent length . some might say tired but i find this rather good . not often one has a swiss wine ! ** tight , sherberty , riesling nose . the fruit quite forward but the excellent length suggests a good future . *** quite intense . oily hazelnuts . good length . top *** over-charred wood . gutsy palate - slight harshness on the finish . this does all moderate with time and there is good fruit . i 'm not so keen on this . bare *** rather oxidised . not rated unforthcoming nose . forward pinot fruit - quite ripe - high-toned cranberry-edged fruit . very nice . *** a little richer and riper . darker and deeper . good length . another top *** dry raspberry fruit . dry palate - not insubstantial . stylish terroir wine . a bit short but good . *** slightly sweeter , mineral , riper , palate . complete wine - very good indeed . **** soft fruit - slight spritz . gets much better - white pepper nose . silky fruit . a bit less characterful . less sauvage than last two - almost soft . some oak influence . *** perhaps just the great vintage but drier and more terroir-driven . very , very good . possibly could do with another year or two . **** lots of botrytis . nice balance . lovely . *** baked fruits - refined , bags of ripe fruit , sweet yet firmly structured - balanced , long . excellent port from a house that i do n't usually pay much attention to . *** ( * ) slightly corked . not rated deep orange colour - apricot fruit - pleasant but odd . an attempt at ol-fashioned winemaking that does n't quite come off ? ** dry quite closed still . high-toned fruit . needs time . a low *** deeply meaty , round - some tannins . rather good . *** ( * ) very pure raspberry fruit - savoury - good length . scrapes **** quite engaging in its way - almost dry , appley . fragrant and attractive *** quite fresh and nicely autolytic . good balance . very drinkable . *** finer , more intense and more elegant . pretty classy . scrapes **** richer and a bit more structured than the previous wine . quite serious . needs a few years . *** ( * ) pure , balanced , nice food wine . easy ** bone dry , pleasant , a little light beside the pouilly . ** softer and fruitier on the palate than the gc - two patches of vines that are quite close together . they are quite different but i wonder if one could or should blend them . ** clean , dry , but with underlying richness and some minerality . good . *** a decent step up to real grand cru quality . good length . top *** a bit soft and unfocussed beside the colombier wines but i find it hard to say whether it is producer-style or the dreaded hot vintage syndrome striking again . a good ** straightforward clean , dry , decent chablis . top ** confusion marketing i feel . this wine sells for a tiny bit more and has quite a lot of added richness . i 'd pay the extra every time . *** extravagantly rich and mouthfilling , oak-influenced . i need to have a proper drink of this sometime to decide whether it carries it off . it quite possibly does , in which case *** full and rich - tending towards a fatness which while clearly in balance i sometimes find too much in carillon 's wines . scrapes *** understated , dry ( none of that fatness the village wine has ) lots of puligny character . good balance and excellent length . ** ( ** ) rounder and more easy-going than the perrieres . still good balance and a fine wine , but this can happily be drunk now although surely it will improve a touch . *** ( * ) nicely made meursault , nice balance , although perhaps with an air of being what it is : a very good village wine and without 1er cru distinction . bare *** charcterful , gutsy meursuault with a bit of bitterness on the finish that i 'm not sure i like so much . perhaps this will depart with a year or two in bottle . for now , judgement reserved . not rated a bit richer and broader with good length . very nice . *** a special selection , i think and notably more expensive . quite serious , concentrated fruit and good structure and so you get what you pay for . *** a bit clarety - fruit tending toward cassis and some wood influence , i think . pleasant enough . ** quite large and broad , a food wine i think , and it will take a few years aging quite well . a cortese and chardonnay blend . at least a top ** pleasant forward fruit with a twist of bitterness . not bad at all . top * method champenois from chardonnay and pinot - idiosynchratic wine with a touch of pink and some high-toned red wine aromas . i 'd like to try some more . at least a top ** nebbiolo barbera blend quite heavily oaked . quite good of its sort . ** fragrant , elegant fruit - lots of underlying tannins . fairly modern-styled . needs a few years and on the way up but perhaps not beyond a good *** rounded , suave fruit , some tannins but would be fine with food . top ** silky , burgundian but structured . very fine but i sometimes feel sandrone 's wines are a bit of a trick - almost too polished . bare *** ( * ) a touch larger and richer i think . like the la vigne , modern-style but without excessive oak influence . *** ( * ) nicely poised , splendid balance , clean and pure . sophisticated wine . ** nicely done , although to my taste it might be better without the barriques . * pure , very restrained varietal statement ( a plus point ) . nice . top * richer - 2003 was very warm here too i think . similar quality . top * an exotic blend of chardonnay , sauvignon blanc and pinot grigio i think - rather nicely constructed . a wine that i would like to sit down and try properly - i suspect it would repay scrutiny and so let 's say *** lovely texture , lovely fruit , nice acidity and length . very fine . top *** i do n't taste a lot of young tokaji - this though seems very promising . *** as above but added richness . top *** raspberry and chocolate fruit - a lesser vintage that you could almost drink now . pretty good . *** aniseed , baked fruit , very dense . i hardly ever drink young port but i am sure this will be very good . ** ( ** ) intense , sweet blackberry nose and concentrated palate . very much new-wave rioja . good , yes ( very good in its way ) - interesting , less so at least to me . *** higher toned and with very evident tannins , but very much in the same style . seriously pricey - same as a bottle of rioja alta 's famous 890 . give me the latter any day . top *** curious - it seems to have old-fashioned touches of volatility but generally a modern style . pretty good . bare *** reliable ridge - pretty good . bare *** classic - quite bordeaux on the nose but with an extra ripeness even more evident on the palate . still , quite classically styled and very fine . *** ( * ) at nahm restaurant at the halkin hotel in london ( very good food by the way ) with a thai meal . touch of residual co2 , luscious ripe fruit already showing some maturity - so quite forward . very lovely . *** pleasant but slightly flat-textured . bare *** touch of sulphur evident . good , gutsy , big . top *** dark colour . v flat and odd . not rated sound , clear , high-toned - quite pulignyish . actually rather intense and long . good *** yuk ! unpleasant nose of a really odd and undescribable sort . blows off to a large extent , but still not rated slightly sulphury - clean palate tight , quite long . a bit thin at first - certainly less than the other meursaults good *** dry austere long . more intense . opens up dramatically - peaches , minerals . very nice . bare **** intense very long . just what one might hope for . top **** gamy , rustic , mentholy , liquorice , high-toned . earthy . others liked this a bit more but i 'd say just pretty good . *** a bit fizzy - wears off . high-toned , cherry fruit . very attractive . *** ( * ) intense , dry , balanced , earthy , structured . very nice indeed . *** ( * ) bone-dry , nutty nose , slightly gluey palate . pretty fine but i have reservations about the gluey component . could do with a year or two . *** slightly sweeter style ( dessert rather than aperetif ) - but reasonable acid balance . nice grapey fruit . ** apricot jam - quite a lot of botrytis - modest acidity . decent rather than excellent length . perfectly nice but a bit simple for a top wine - unless it is in a quiet phase . a bare ** ( * ) very honey and orange peel - pretty sweet - modest acidity - and so a little cloying . might come in to better balance in time but i 'm not sure . may be just a bit overdone . not quite my style , but *** lots of apricot , coconut , banana , and exotic fruit . big and rich yet so complex . lovely and will be great . **** ( * ) limey - seems lightweight at first but that 's probably just following yquem . good intensity and length . lovely complexity too . *** ( * ) apples , cinnamon and bananas ( someone said ) . disjointed acidity . a gentle but in fact quite persistent finish . a touch towards cloying but very good of its type . others will like this more . ** all wines drunk at crantock bay hotel overlooking the bay during an enjoyable family holiday . an intersting wine list - just the sort of things after those long days surfing the atlantic rollers . ( ok , body-boarding on my four-year-olds mickey mouse body board . ) good , warm , bordeaux-blend red from argentina for drinking fairly young . *** simple rather unbalanced shiraz with some vibrancy . * fresh , fruity stuff with a good balancing acidity . no great complexity . ** good food wine - hearty and with some tannin . ** light syrah fragrance and good balance . medium weight for short term drinking . ** i probably always have higher expectations of a wine with the name `perrin ' on it than i should do . maybe i should always taste them blind . this wine lacks dimension and does n't really excite . * peachy , spicy , rounded , very elegant . modest acidity . for drinking . bare *** richer , more mineral , slightly better grip . *** unforthcoming at first . emerges - more mineral than above - altogether more substantial . a serious long-term wine . *** ( * ) oxidised . not rated pleasantly rich . honied , intense . very good . bare **** exotic , rich , sweeter than just off-dry . top *** cherries , high-oned chalky minerality . very firm and very good - perhaps a touch less silkyily fine than more recent fourrier vintages . bare ***** soft , rounded touch of mint . fleshy . very nice . **** rounded and ripe . soft and delicious . slightly more `` cooked '' . bare **** a touch lighter than the other two vintages but very fine and nicely wrought . **** creamy apricots - very nice , if a bit simple . bare *** fairly dry , a touch more complex than the sauternes - rather fine *** rose-petals , touch of marzipan , lots of glycerol , creamy , very lovely . ***** corked not rated strawberries and a touch of yeastiness . elegantly balanced . *** clear riesling nose with a touch of sweet toffee that 's probably come with the maturity . **** rather charmingly fragrant nose of violets . modern chianti for drinking young . *** easy , clean burgundy without huge depth but with purity of fruit . *** an intersting comparsion wine to the earlier chianti . this is more robust and has a slight bitterness to the fruit . holding up well , and probalbly needs more time . **** very graceful , almondy nose - slightly floral , but pleasingly free of overt varietal statement . ( i think it 's a blend of various varieties , for what it 's worth . ) on the palate , completely balanced with perfect acidity and a touch of ripe lemon around a concentrated but understated palate . very fine . **** seems quite oxidatively made . stony , meaty rather than elegant . pretty nice but not out of this world . *** good colour , black-cherry nose . fruit quite baked in character and at first it seems to have a hole in the mid-palate . but that seemed to fill in once the bottle had been open a while . chunky and without the complexity to be really classy . *** dense young colour and intense black cherry and cough-sweet nose . despite the concentration of fruit it 's very silky on the palate with a background of ripe tannins . very luscious . seems almost less approachable the next day , which is a bit frightening . top stuff . **** ( * ) a long maceration job , in the style of gravner , but from garganega from gambellara just outside soave . deeply coloured but slightly cloudy , with a flat peachy nose . slight spritz on the fruit . interesting but slightly flawed i feel . i 'll keep a look out for further vintages but just a good ** creamy texture and hight-toned herby fruit . very dry and quite stylish but perhaps it was better a few years ago - it does seem to be drying out a bit . top ** refined - mineral richness , nice balance all through . pretty dry and clean . good stuff . *** ( * ) healthy colour . fragrant rose-garden nose with cedar and tobacco notes . the fruit quite sweet and ripe . this seems resolved but lasts well overnight . rather good . **** quite chocolatey - fruit seems a touch attenuated at first but opens up to a delicious blueberry-raspberry mixture . from a half . bare **** apples , spices , quite exotic , rather rich fruit , high acidity . pinot weightiness on the palate . needs a couple of years in bottle . *** ( * ) attractive , silky grenache fruit . very drinkable . *** not a property i 've drunk much recently and it used to be a bit of a joke for producing `` englishman 's claret '' . they 've done quite well in this vintage though : quite powerful and structured , good fruit , drinkable now but probably more so in a couple of years . good at the price . ** ( * ) lovely , vibrant , deep pink colour . once open for a quarter of an hour , a delicious nose of strawberry fruit . quite vinous - like a substantial still rose rather than champagne with a touch of colour . long finish . will probably benefit from a year or two in bottle . top *** lead pencil nose - a fair amount of new oak i suspect . fairly lightweight and elegant - perhaps to excess . not like jasmin of old . bare *** suspiciously deep colour . really a bit overly oxidative but underneath there 's nice honied fruit . bare *** pure , pleasant . top ** nice fruit - fruitcake - good structure . could do with a year or two . decent balance . ** vanilla - weight of a traditional wine - but the fruit quite bright and fresh cherry . pleasant . worth ** talento is apparantly a trademark of a consortium of growers in northern italy making methode champenoise fizz from mainly champagne grapes . this is made by prosecco producer bisol . it has the charcteristic yeasty character , fine fruit , it 's dry but not over-austere . nice - it might make an interesting ringer in a flight of growers champagnes . *** moderate weight , quite burgundian quality , fairly high-toned . very good drinking . top *** piercing tar and roses nose . still a touch hard on the palate , bone dry with quite a lot of tannin . drinkable but will improve a bit , i think . bare *** ( * ) grassy , slightly flabby fruit . * softly grassy , fruity , floury ( meunier , i guess ) flowers . white bread . pleasant finish . good . *** slightly sicky edge to the fruit . rather dominated by red wine characters . i 'm not so keen . ** rather soft , easy fruit - both nose and palate . quite rich , briochey . to drink quite soon - but good . bare **** red fruits , frothy , quite weighty . good strawberry finish . top *** ( a blend of 95 and 96 ) creamy , gamy , rich , stewed apples and strawberries again . rather good . perhaps even **** reserved , pure , stony . mineral , strawberries again . medium-weight and excellent length . *** ( * ) very nice , quite creamy , mineral . persistent . a good **** gingery fruit , pleasant but a bit dull . ** now more evolved , rich , low-acid mature rhone . ** rich , deep-coloured , rather new-oak influenced , seems oxidative . in danger of being overwrought - not clear where this is going . has some character though . ** again deep-coloured , ambitious . not that exciting to drink now - but it might improve . ** creamy , minerals , delicious . ***** very elegant , moderate weight , quite complex and an excellent finish for the vintage . **** chestnut , coffee , lovely ripe fruit . quite fresh and fruity . still well-structured but drinking well - no hurry to drink this . **** a little difficult at first . then rounded christmas-cake fruit . less exotic than the 85 and more 1-dimensional . top *** two halves , the better nicely balanced , biscuity , digestible . top *** rather lovely , fresh , high-toned , dry and savoury . top *** baked fruits . balanced ( 12.5 % a ! ) , creamy . the finish suggests it needs drinking over the next few years . *** bags of botrytis but a bit coarse . ** a sample sent by the winery fresh , strawberry and redcurrant flavours with good balancing acidity and a touch of eldeflower . good , easy drinking for a summer 's evening . ** frizzante , only 6.5 % alcohol , pleasantly refreshing . rather like a moscato but floral rather than grapey . it says `` dolce '' on the corner of the label - it 's about demi-sec and nicely in balance of rthe style . ideal for sunny garden evenings . well made . ** rather good fruit , oak fairly evident on the palate but probably not excessive ( although i must say i like less and less oak in my wines ) , quite mineral too . could do with a bit longer in bottle but probably wo n't make four stars as it seems just a bit simple by the highest standards . *** it 's sad , but waitrose is much better than any previous source of fruit and veg in the city . toffee and caramel , quite maderised and a bit vegetal but maintaining interest and drinkability despite being past its best . i oscillate between finding this too far-gone and admiring it . a reminder of what over-old white burgundy should be like , as compared to the current rash of prematurely oxidised wines that are simply rotting . some will find this unappetising but i 'll settle on ** lively , high-toned , more suggestive of puligny than chassagne . good acidity and quite mineral . very nice - what i hoped rather more 96 's would be like ! *** ( * ) bready , elegant , moderate weight ( perhaps down to age ) , lemony . long rich finish . a top *** softly peachy fruit . easy stuff nicely made . top * touch drier , richer , more serious but still fairly easy . good ** a bit more depth and all-round strength with some positive evolution ahead . not really long-term though . ** ( * ) fragrant , dry long . very attractive . *** rather rubbery - this bottle somewhat oxidised . good underneath i think . not rated dry and perfumed - gamy end . a star . more or less drinking now . ***** lovely biscuity nose . balanced fruit - complex long , and lovely . **** fantastic concentration . thoroughly integrated after a fascinating nose . a great wine if not terribly cote-rotie . beginning to hint at volatility so time to drink , i feel . ***** piquant - tending towards edgyness . still rather good mature wine . top *** quite dry barley-sugar fruit . intense - lots of fruit almost obscuring lots of botrytis . rich and very good - **** ( * ) quite liquoricey , sweet - spirit a bit disjoint currently - raisiny fruit . extravagantly sweet ripe . nice but suspect balance to me currently - it might well improve . *** ( * ) the friends very kindly came with two bottles of champagne - one a back-up bottle in case the main one was n't showing well . possibly just past its peak , but a nice wine for those who like their champagne old ( which i do ) . ok , 1990 is n't that old , but this is n't the greatest name in champagne either . good , slightly oxidised maturity with the 1990s softness evident . *** this bottle has been shouting 'drink me , drink me ! ' for the last couple of years - eyeing me up each time i opened the cellar . i had it last in 1999 , when it was disappointing . this time though it was a glorious claret with warm , pencil-shaving nose and palate . i 'm glad i 've resited its calling until now because this bottle was caught at its best . there is a touch of weediness ( well it 's not the best vintage ever ) , but the balance is fine . this is the sort of wine that makes keeping fine wine so satisfying . i could drink a lot of this , alas though this was my last bottle . a charming **** a coarser wine than the pichon above , with higher toned acidity and a more granular structure . good , pleasant wine that held its own . a good , solid *** from a half . marmalade nose , and a waxy , lanolin palate . a bit simple possibly , but showing rather nicely . *** i ca n't usually get too excited about sancerre , but this is rather enjoyable . it has enough age to have lost its initial zing , but still has a pleasing balance of fruit , acid and honeyed , grassy flavours . *** this is syrah , garnacha and tempranillo in the ratio 7:2:1 . modern wine , but well made with a dryness of fruit balanced by good tannins . a bit closed at present i feel , but it probably has some potential . a cautious ** ( * ) rich and satisfying yet balanced . has benefited from a bit of cellaring . an under-rated house . a good *** wax , lanolin , quite dry , grass and corn . very , very long . really lovely . ***** a little lighter at first but very similar in character to the haut brion tasted with it . long again . fills out nicely once it has been open a while . excellent . ***** fragrant fruity nose , liquorice , mineral palate . really interesting wine . **** lovely dry savoury palate . sucks from your tongue after a ripe start . classic mature claret and really good . ***** open , fruity nose - lovely irony palate . scrapes ***** quiet nose - totally individual irony , dry , complex , long palate . a great pleasure . ***** stylish , high-toned . integrated botrytis . a really good wine from a property that does n't always do it for me . **** lightweight , dilutish wine , but clean and otherwise balanced . ** drinking nicely with hints of chocolate and an overarching dryness . a good *** a touch of rusticity in the background behind some good sweet fruit . simple . ** grassy , very dry , elegant , touch of autolysis . lovely balance . **** peachy , off-dry , nice balance . fairly low acid . a lesser vintage but it might well age nicely . *** touch of kerosene , very textured . quite intense and long . the richness is down to a a touch of botrytis apparently . bare **** amazingly long . mineral too . dry , complex . drinking well but completely fresh . gorgeous . scrapes ***** bone-dry , nice range of flavours . very good basic burgundy . ** broader , slightly flatter . quite rich - rather impressive . decent *** a touch of toffee , quite complex . very minty . odd but interesting . very mineral too , which seems a good sign . there 's an element of `` benefit of the doubt '' in going for a bare *** ( * ) very fresh and clean , sophisticated chassagne from a vineyard i had n't really heard of . nicely poised . top *** mainstream , quite beetrooty , fairly rich . very nice . a basic *** rustic edge . dry finish . not totally sucessful in a difficult vintage . *** gamy , exotic . a touch rustic . slightly dry and edgy from the oak . perhaps it will soften but i worry it 's been pushed a bit hard . bare *** rich , full , impressive . carries the oak rather more easily . still a bit hard at the end . *** better drinking - the quality of the vineyard means the fruit has the density to carry the oak . top *** brown sugar - quite restrained . very fine and long . top **** fragrant , easy , light . salty and appetizing . a bit too easy to be great , perhaps . top *** rounded , quite ripe , meaty and tending to decadence . high-toned . very nice if not wildly complex . **** ry , dl and ja came to a small midweek dinner . notes are from memory - i was feeling too lazy to write anything down . elegant , lacks a bit of weight and grip perhaps - mostly the vintage i guess . fine wine but lacking any very special buzz . top *** smoky , refined , holding nicely although for drinking in the next year or two . rather lovely . top **** reminder to self : i must stop thinking of eighties clarets as infants . this is pretty much mature although it will probably evolve interestingly over a decade or more . very classic cigar-box and cassis . a pleasure to drink . top **** exotic , or perhaps i just do n't drink enough brunello . fresh , herby , redolent in a curious way of ice-cream . very attractive . top *** coming towards maturity - great breeding : fine balance in quite a weighty wine . all the classic barsac characteristics . **** green-rimmed , quite fresh , elegant nose . perhaps lacking the weight and complexity of the best colheitas but a rather good drink . slips down very easily - the bottle is empty today ! top *** a bit disappointing - too easy to drink . that may sound odd , but i want my chablis with some green acidity and this wine is too soft and lacking structure . having said that , it 's not bad . i suppose a grudging *** easy , peachy fruit . pleasantly fruity . ** fragrant in an oily sort of way . a touch flabby . fading . * rieslingy . nice weight . bare ** ( * ) a bit flatter and a touch dull . ok , but only ** dry , good concentration . nice balance . top quality in a restrained style . *** ( * ) mineral . good length . lovely too . *** ( * ) lifted cherry cough sweet . pleasant wine . ** similar , quite concentrated . bigger and riper . bare *** quite suave . serious . a touch of vanilla . modern-style - `` fut de chene '' proudly advertised -never a good sign . ** a bit hollower . corked . not rated stylish mature wine . fades in the glass though . bare *** a bit rougher but interesting . mature rustic wine - reasonable enough . bare *** very pale . thin on the palate . a curiosity - technically french but made in the southern hemisphere . no stars middle weight - a bit colourless . * xmas cakey muscatel grapes . citric . quite sweet but balanced . nice . *** drier , nicely poised . slightly hot , bitter finish . bare *** orange peel , grapes and cofee beans . smoky . interesting . a good *** almost a maderised feel to it with honeyed apples and a slight woodiness on the nose . good stuff . *** opened with trepidation given toby 's recent article ablout 1996 white burgundy . this one , however , was fine . elegant , light to medium bodied and with good use of oak . good texture to the wine . possibly needs more time in bottle to be at its absolute best . **** i do n't know whether to score this wine or not . when first opened there was an immediate whiff of corkiness . however , returning to the wine later in the evening no corkiness was present , but it did seem a bit flabby and with an oxidised edge . i am now drinking the rest of the bottle as i type . again , when i first took the cork out ( a different cork to keep it stoppered up over night ) a corky edge lurked within the wine . but it disappeared ! as had the oxidised edge ! the wine i am drinking now is a delight of steely mature chardonnay . wine left overnight like this usually leaves me cold ( see the note for pichon '92 below ) . but this wine seems to be living in reverse ( if i left it another few days i 'd probably end up with a bunch of grapes ) . quite a lot of crystals are present in the wine ( they actually made a noise on the bottom of the glass when i poured the last glass from the bottle ) . scored as it is now drinking : top *** beginning to tire - fruit oxidising . drinkable , but not for too much longer . *** a joy . not a wine that needs too much thinking about , but delivers what is expected of a decent twenty-year-old pauillac . elegance and grace , and with the clarety minerality of age . at peak , i think , but no rush to drink up . **** i have quite a lot of this wine , and i have been a bit concerned of more recent times whether i needed to rush to drink it up . on this bottle 's showing , i need not have too many worries about that . not quite up to the standard of the previous wine ( it somehow lacks the breeding ) , but good nonetheless with fruit and maturity working well together . no rush to drink up . **** a bottle opened the night before which ljm brought round on the off chance . alas , not really fair to judge this wine in such condition . so i wo n't score . not rated from a half . dark tarry , amber colour . lovely black treacle nose . *** theme of alsace white `` preferably on the vt+ side of richness '' and `` spanish reds from anywhere ( but obviously from spain ) '' . oh , and a fizz to start with . inferior italian fizz . soft . * from a two-third . sweet and muscaty soft . not a style i enjoy . *** i thought this was riesling ! some sweetnes and richness with a touch of steel . not as long as it might be . *** corked ! not rated very thin compared with the other wines of the evening ( my fault for bringing it ! ) . good , but not showing as well as it should . liquorice and mineral . i liked it , others did n't . *** from a half . vegetal , coarse . varnishy . astringent finish . odd . * sweet botrytisy nose . lovely balance . delicious . a top **** good colour , a touch green on the palate . decent . *** slightly metallic , some age . not much going on . *** young coloured - subdued nose . oak and good , closed tannins . **** smokey tempranillo . delicious . pick of the reds for me . **** young and deep and with sweetness . tannins , but a bit volatile . ** more age than others - a touch tarry . not quite together . but ok. *** from a half - i think . tasted ( ? ) at the end of the evening . ca n't remember much about it , and i did n't make notes . but i seem to have scribbled down **** good textured wine , with slightly bitter tannins . black cherry fruit . *** mineral , dry , fairly austere , quite flavoury . very nice . top *** quite forward - eminently approachable already . authentic burgundy fruit , decent acidity and a sophisticated creaminess to the texture - all very good . it seemed to lack a measure of intensity , particularly late on the palate - it seems to fail to be either properly intellectual or properly hedonistic . a good wine , for drinking over the next couple of years . top *** genuine chalky minerality and , once it has opened up , rich ( but not excessively so ) nectarine-kernel fruit . nice acidity and good length . starting to drink quite well now but no hurry to consume . easy ** ( * ) clean , mineral , pure and delicious . *** it 's a good trick , combining tautness and minerality with creamy-textured fruit . delicious - and nosign of the problems thatplague the vintage . bare *** ( * ) rich and full , fairly advanced ( as the wines from this producer often are ) but no sign of the premature oxidation tha plagues the vintage . there 's a bitter edge to the fruit that stops me giving the highest rating - it 's a funny thing , bitterness : sometimes it seems an asset to a wine sometimes a problem . i 'm not so keen on its manifestation in this wine . still a top *** rich , quite fat , slightly off-dry . forward ( perhaps the vintage ) and nicely mouthfilling . a good *** high-toned , dry , floral . mineral . ** ( * ) richer , keroseney , slightly off-dry ( this vintage was quite warm in nz too ) . balanced , long . forward . *** fat , quite evolved . dry and balanced but the fruit does n't quite have the tone . a good ** ungainly now . hard . fantastic underlying concentration , comlexity and length - will be excellent . ** ( ** ) dry but rich . complex , still a bit hard . **** ( * ) fantastic complexity - resolved i guess but nowehere close to decline . a delight and like the previous two wines , quite firm and masculine . ***** high-toned , so juicy . lovely . structured . *** ( * ) riper and bigger . complex and delicious . a bit easy-going to be really great . bare **** shoe-polish . showing its age a bit . no more than *** slightly off in some hard-to-place way . not rated lovely - completely fresh , complex and long . easy **** pale but green rim . loads of brown sugar . fantastic fruit . a lovely dessert wine . **** high-toned nose hinting at aniseed . quite sweet light-to-medium weight palate . very fragrant and elegant . others found things they were less keen on in this wine but for me a top *** tropically edged green-pea fruit . manages to be quite easily fruity but pretty dry and appetising . good intensity and length . very pure and enjoyable . ** light-coloured , fragrant , pinot-like . really fairly simple but pleasant . makes ** intense brambly fruit - quite forward . easy-going , more or less drinking now . *** dark and dense - wood still a bit evident on a concentrated background . as it opens up it is just simply very good . *** ( * ) the fruit seems very mature - almost over . herby - quite complex . still quite tannic . as paolo de marchi remarked , there can be a problem with sangiovese of the fruit maturing before the tannins . bare **** quite mineral as cabernet goes . rounded , easy , very drinkable , but without the edge of the ceparello . *** a bit higher-toned perhaps . more tannins but generally a little bit thinner . still nicely elegant . ** ( * ) quite sweet . fairly sherried and very intense . lovely concentration . **** one of those wines that is just bordering on the past it , but is still pleasant and intersting to drink : it 's possibly just that bit too oxidised , but this has given it a nutty character . ** rather disjointed and disappointing - a bit volatile . it might come together , but i think not . * not something to get too excited about , but with decent , sweet strawberry/cherry fruit . ** undrinkable . past it . musty vinegar . not rated elegant , fine , fruity , long , long finish . **** mahogany - dry , oozing age , complex , quite challenging and altogether wonderful . ***** elegant , savoury , rather good . *** really nice - just a hint of sweetness - chocolate fruit . top *** gamy , rustic , straw nose . nice fruit . idiosyncratic but nice . lovely . top *** light-medium weight elegant , high-toned . strawberry - perfumed . dry . very good . decent *** much more dense - cassis fruit . a very substantial wine - but nice balance . maybe even *** ( * ) taught , dry and structured , fragrant too . high-toned , complex . good *** tending towards leafy , high-toned , hints of tobacco . very mineral and stylish . *** ( * ) slightly softer riper and rounder . still nicely structured . probably a better all-round wine than the 2000 . *** ( * ) pure dry rich - elegant . top *** more spicy ( white pepper ) complex long . *** ( * ) more mineral . spicy . delicious . top *** ( * ) a bit enigmatic . intense - concentrated . this may be beginning to emerge . *** ( * ) sage and onion stuffing - cranberries . strange but splendid . **** light fragile colour , sweet dilutish strawberry colour . pleasant enough . ** well put together tight wine , bright and vibrant . good fruit , nice balance . probably only for short term aging . a good ** ( * ) white bread leaps about of the bottle on opening . nutty , dry , green apples - the fruit changes every time you come back to it . a prestige cuvee that lives up the billing . lovely drinking . easy **** could do with another year or so to mellow , but this is nicely structured fizz with floral aromas and refined , appley pinot fruit ( it 's a bdn , i believe ) with overtones of white chocolate . pleasingly dry . top *** a blend of grapes from 89,90 and 91 - cuvee 5 , disgorged march 04 . fresh bread and apple nose , rich full yeasty and meaty palate . perhaps in danger of being a bit coarse without food ( as blanc de noirs sometimes are ) - possibly a little more time in bottle will help . complex and with a long , honied finish . this opens up with a little breathing and is really rather good . top **** honey , yeast , apples - a complex nose and palate that repays attention . this still seems a bit tightly wound as yet . my impression is that while very good there 's no extra depth of character apparent from its `` single vineyard '' status . a prestige cuvee i 'll try again but i wo n't be rushing . bare **** unpleasantly oxidised . i hope this is an odd bottle . not rated a half , opened rather soon after shipping . seemed confected and estery at first , quite citric but with decent concentration . i think this is better than it initially seems . let 's say it is scraping *** white bread and currants on the nose . light to medium weight - elegant fruit . quite a lot of meunier - which shows slightly negatively on the palate . very good but could one ask for slightly more intensity without sacrificing the elegance ? i 'm not sure . i 'm being critical - but this is very nice . ( 2001 plus reserve wines - disgorged june 2004 - i like the informative back-label ) . very top *** rich nose - chocolate , yeast , dense fruit . quite a weighty , vinous palate - perhaps a bit heavy at the moment and perhaps rather wood-influenced , but this might mellow with a year or two in bottle into something very fine . might even rate another star in its way but for now *** touch of white bread but mainly ripe granny smith apples on the nose . pretty decent basic nv . bare *** perfectly pleasant but a bit nondescript . this has aged ok without really developing in an interesting way . *** this is rather dominated by farmyard straw on the nose an palate - too rustic for me in a way that i do n't think will improve with age . ok , but no more than that . bare *** 100 % old-vine pinot meunier and thus interesting . floral and perhaps floury ( or am i being influenced by the name of the grape ) fruit , quite forward in the mouth and a bit colourless on the mid-palate with an ordinary finish . real champagne balance ( quite dry ) makes it pretty drinkable however , although it is hard to find much real complexity . an oddity that is worth trying , particularly if one wants to get a grip on the grape and what it might contribute to wines like moet nv , for instance . scrapes *** quite autolytic , appley fruit , complex an honied , quite dry and with good pinot gutsiness . all this after seeming a bit maderised at first , but as often with champagne this seemed to blow off . excellent . **** citric , appley nose with yeasty notes - quite complex . ripe , rounded fruit despite the excellent acidity of the vintage - needs a bit more time though - aspects of it seem quite tightly wound still . quite long too and creamy textured . **** ( * ) light to medium weight , elegant , complex and nutty , quite long . just occasionally it seems a little oily/keroseney on the palate but that may be the food i am having with it . really pretty good , although probably for drinking over the next couple of years . a good deal from oddbins at not muchover ł20 . bare **** a bit coarse on first sip , but this seems less noticable afterwards . the fruit quality is a way short of champagne so a fairly basic wine . pleasnat enough . * one of those evenings with a lot of corked and oxidised bottles - even before i arrived there had been some bad whites ! last taste from a nearly exhhuasted bottle ( i arrived late ) . seemed typically lovely . **** gamy , succulent tannins . lovely . **** slightly corky . not rated completely shot - oxidised . not rated gamy , warm berries , very pleasant - typical mature beaucastel of this period . **** substantial but rather oxidised not rated to make up for the corked rhones ! touch of game , lovely ripe fruit , quite low acid . lovely . **** chocolate , cherries , strawberries , easy , rich yet appealing . lovely complex palate . really , really top port . ****** complete wine - really pretty good but so upstaged by the niepoort . bare *** ( * ) mainly from my own cellar , tasted in the last month or two quite mineral , but this seems a bit flabbier , flatter and lacking freshness than i remember . i could worry that we have a touch of premature-oxidation disease here although the wine is perfectly drinkable . i hope it 's an odd bottle , the one i had in july 2004 was fine and i 've had a couple since which i did not note because they were similar . ** nice fruit , very drinkable . quite luscious even with a richness that one might attribute to the standing of the vineyard . good balance too . but nice though it is , i find it rather undemanding - no tautness , no succulence , in short no really grown-up qualities . i 'd hope for more excitment from this vineyard . still a fine drink , and it does n't sell for huge money either . *** a bottle drunk over two evenings as opposed to my last notr from the middle of a wine dinner . bright and attractive raspberry , cranberry and beetroot pinot - a touch of oak and tannins but fundamentally in an easy drinking style . very pleasant drinking but not profound . will improve a touch over a shortish timescale but not a long-term wine . *** very ( excessively even ) citric , good acidity and a modest finish . no sign of 96 oxidation . i was given this knowing only that it was a 96 white burgundy - thought it might be a disappointing grander wine . actually this is rather good for its level . top ** on first opening , bright , high-toned , delciously fruity - mainly red fruits - and with good balance and length . very quaffable . later , some minerality appears too and it seems stylish too . very nice indeed . probably for drinking over the next few years . a very top *** even with decanting , still quite hard and needing food . stylish - i hope it will resolve well . *** a bit reductive at first , opens out to reveal strong high-toned fruit and a bit of pinot animality . a touch hard at the moment , particularly without food , but pretty good . top *** splendidly mineral and delicious . bare **** one bottle rather orange an unpalatable - oxidized burgundy syndrome , i fear . another quite mature and hinting at the same but still rather good and pleasantly drinkable . the good one : ** fresh strawberry fruit , moderate acidity , some tannins and still quite firm although the acidity is moderate . opens out nicely overnight but still has a twist of bitterness at the end of the palate that i have mixed feelings about . bare *** bone-dry , austere at first but then just very classic appetising white burgundy at peak . bare **** the champagne was the last wine of the dinner , and very good it was too . very elegant - specially considering this is blanc de noirs . dry yet very appetizing . bare *** ( * ) quite fine - creamy but a little sweet - lacks minerality and steelyness . *** dumb - or not quite right - could even be the early stages of premature oxidation . not rated tight , dry meursault nuttyness , lovely acid , touch of lemon . very fine . *** ( * ) very fine , balanced , complex . intense , very long . still improving . ***** gamy , nice ruit , earthy , nice but not so long . very pleasant mature wine . *** ravishingly gorgeous , elegant , fragrant fruit . very lovely , if a little light and perhaps no more than it ought to be for a grand cru . some want to keep this for 10 years and ( probably ) good it will be in rather a different way , but i love it now too . ***** lovely mushroomy nose , perfectly fresh , nicely dry . ripe but with excellent acidity and good length . ***** creamy and mineral . excellent **** very mineral , stony and dry , lemony , intense , very raveneau . starting to drink well . **** delicate , fragrant , almost floral . medium-weight palate , succulent tannins gives some bite on the finish . bare **** very evolved colour . open nose , rich , hinting at corruption . slightly open palate that puts me off , but classy irony hints are rather lovely . bare **** a bit grassy and cloying on the finish . i enjoyed this at the square in london a while ago but it seems a bit dull this time . ** bright , clean , nice pure fruit . nice acidity - mouthwatering . scrapes ** ( * ) one bottle a bit cooked and plummy , another brighter and fresher with good density of fruit . not , i suppose the finest or most complex fruit , but nice . the better one a bare *** quite rustic , light-bodied but quite intense . characterful . top ** quite leesy and rich - chassagne-like . a touch showy perhaps . top ** nice tone , appetising . ** friends brought this round for lunch . lovely medium weight burgundy with touches of toffee , nuts and melon . good to have a wine that does n't seem sterile in its freshness and is n't trying to be any more than it should be . *** and here 's the coincidence . i just happened to drag this out of the racks in preparation for the same lunch . this , as one would expect , has more signs of age - there 's also a slight dirtiness/stalkiness to the wine ( again none of that sterility that can make some modern wine so boring ) . good maturing burgundy . *** this wine has been a bit of an enigma over the years - toby and i have both given varying reports . this bottle , however , was exactly what it should be . fresh and vibrant , sweet strawberry and beetroot , and with good acidity . more than pleasant . **** bright and high-toned . good . ** nice fruit concentration . good acidity . bare ** ( * ) added complexity . fine length . ** ( * ) restrained - gives the impression of being a bit less complex - or is it just a bit closed ? bare ** ( * ) the nightmare vintage - this is quite restrained to the point that i worry a bit about its weight . it 's retained some good puligny character though . bare *** pure pinot - simple but nicely balanced . bare ** richer and more complex . ** again richer and nicely textured . quite dry with a touch of minerality . approaching *** youngish vines but good definition with bright fruit . bare ** ( * ) elegant -

round , ripe fruit . lovely . ***** pleasant old thing , without being special . top *** quite botrytised . elegant , lighter weight but nice intensity . *** darker , larger . burnt marmalade . very rieussec . perhaps needs time . *** ( * ) a bit dry , light , hard - a bit low on fruit . a touch spirity but quite intense . *** lovely , classic bordeaux nose . bright fruit , but a very odd , harsh , late-palate and a slightly hot finish that leaves bitterness in the mouth . would be lovely except for that . *** very nice - mineral , classic claret . lovely balance right through . for drinking . top *** medium weight with a lovely savoury palate and a touch ( not unpleasant now they are resolved ) of the vintages tannins . i like this a lot - probably has more time left than the 81 . bare **** very nicely classic . cigar box and sweet , ripe fruit nose . follows through nicely with a high-toned palate . bare **** a bit faded , but alive and quite pleasant - splendid effort for the vintage . very drinkable . from a half . top ** intriguing brown-sugar nose with lots of mineral terroir notes . very classic and savoury - gorgeous . returning to it : walnut nose and the palate too is like licking one . high-toned again . really splendid but still needs time . ***** ( * ) classic , quite austrere and high toned - very 66 . good length too , but it seems just very slightly corked . clearly excellent , but i 'll not rate it . not rated stunning mix of flavours - quite fascinating . hints at an edgy volatility too . delicious but needs drinking - it may be a bit unstable . top **** perfectly balanced mature claret - so mineral . an absolute pleasure from beginning to end . ***** stands out above the last two wines with an amazing extra depth and huge complexity . suave , yet dry . very , very long . no hurry to drink . ****** very ripe and rounded - silky rich texture and a long , complex palate . relatively forward . i can see how this got its rave reviews from parker , but on returning there are piquant notes too . top **** corked . not rated hopelessly oxidised - surely an odd bottle . not rated much more classic than the 90 - dry , flavoury with marked tannins . my impression is that while very good this wo n't become a star like the 70 or 61 - it seems a touch lighter . *** ( * ) exotic coconut nose , creamy . not claret as we know it , but fascinating . there 's great depth and structure and so this probably will be stunning in a while . bare **** ( * ) young wine cassis - but montrose minerality too . fairly ripe - it seems in a slightly softer more modern style than the later wines in this flight . good though . *** liquid minerals and excellent fruit . very good and will be lovely . *** ( * ) very dense - a cross between 98 and 90 . qute a monster , but perhaps some of the older wines were that way in their youth . still , this will surely be lovely in ten years . *** ( ** ) mineral again but a bit more restrained and classic - less exotic than the 96 . i like it a lot - almost more than the 96 - very stylish and balanced . *** ( ** ) a blend of 91 , 90 and 89 . apple and mushroom nose and palate - very meaty and substantial . big finish . **** two bottles , quite different . one very honied and becoming a bit austere . one fresher with nice richness . both quite good . *** pleasant old thing - it may be the end of a long night , but it seems just to be fading a touch . *** nutty , honied , touch of herbs , quite elusive - occasionally has a certain flatness . rather attractive . *** very reductive but after a while in the glass , fragrant , sous-bois , nutty . real tar and roses . reveals more each time ypon come back to it . bare ***** very pleasantly fruity although a touch of oxidation too . some bottle variation . drink up . good *** fresh , mainstream old barolo - tar and roses again . very nice . **** mushrooms , underbrush . pure fruit . still quite primary of course . dry and savoury . *** ( * ) an ancient-looking bottle . appetising , nutty , good length . pleasing fruity background . very nice . bare **** petrolly almost . rich fruit . quite burgundian . probably ageworthy . a good *** ripe , fruity . rather simple . quite new worldy . ** quite characterful . mothbally fruit . i like it in a way -

touch caramelly perhaps but good old sherry - lovely oloroso like texture . clearly been in bottle for decades . good *** even more luscious . ethereal , nutty , long . fascinating - even more so given the the lack of clarity about what it is . ***** clean , dry , a bit leafy . modern styled - could be anything . * very nice - less characterful than tondonia and this seems only to be a crianza . still very drinkable . top ** creamy , citric , long . lovely fine texture . needs a year or two . lovely . bare **** ( * ) rich , wine gums , very tannic and structured . rather bitter currently . rather extracted . new oak ? *** cough-sweets , concentrated , extracted , tiring . *** not unlike the previous wine but less overwrought . fine . good *** rather vaish -

but very good . **** spice and marmalade - intense - stands up to french examples very well . very good indeed of its type . *** lovely - hints at old sherry and madeira . fantastically elegant and fine from appearance to finish . stunning . ***** floral , suggestions of warm hay . light , refreshing , noticably off-dry . ** a single vineyard wine . floral , richer and better delineated than the basic wine . very drinkable . *** a special selection from various vineyards . dumb on the nose with some yeasty notes . very much demi-sec but nicely balanced with a rich palate . *** cartizze is meant to be the very best area . demi-sec again with a refined , complex nose and the sweetness seems in balance . quite long . top *** still prosecco - it does seem rather featureless ! * a passito wine made from prosecco grapes and bottled from a solera established in 1991 ( this example bottled in 2003 ) . banana nose , elegant , attractive palate . very nice . at least *** the usual zoo - bottles everywhere , great fun . the notes are consequently quite brief and impressionistic . nice nose but rather off-dry on the palate - spoils a nice wine . bare *** a domaine in quintaine ( macon ) . charming and easy - in the best sort of way . a great advert for basic burgundy . ** delightful . time to drink this , i think . *** intense , sherberty , rather closed - needs time . at least ** ( * ) alive , fishy-metallic old burgundy - touch of 83 tannins . could be better i suppose , given the terroir . others were n't so keen but for me a top *** high-toned , bright , delicious . **** grenache - ripe - luscious ( nice vintage , i suppose ) . some complaints that it was light and burgundian - but i thought it just proper grenachey chateauneuf . pleasant but fading just a bit . *** very fine indeed . ***** pure , structured , intense but unforced . has the makings of a classic la chapelle . *** ( * ) pure and elegant but very gutless and lacking complexity . disappointing . a sign that jaboulet is losing it ? ** kerosene , intense , ok but not huge acidity . very nice . **** not the best bottle - woody taint . still fine . i 'd give this three stars but i know it 's an even better wine . not rated ice-cream - lovely , dry , piquant palate - intense . quite tannic . perhaps **** luxury pudding wine - fresh ( disgorged 2003 i believe ) . complex and lovely though i wonder if it would be better brut . a taste of how champagne was a century ago . top *** pleasant old thing - without being particularly striking . *** like all the gravner whites , a deep golden colour quite unlike most modern white wines . jammy nectarine nose , rather red-wine-like . grapey peach palate , long and honied . striking and interesting . it has the structure ( some tannins ) and balance to improve . lovely . **** ( * ) a little diffuse on the nose by comparison - there 's some extra complexity from the odd mix of grapes involved , but i feel that is superficial and i prefer the honied purity of the ribolla . excellent again . **** honied nectarine again , excellent but lacking the depth of the 1999 - also perhaps a touch `` flatter '' . still exciting . bare **** interesting , fine flavours - again a lot less weighty than the 1999 . perhaps scrapes in at **** at first very closed , on nose and palate . apples and pears emerge with time on the former and honey on the latter . rather higher acidity . very strong . i think this will turn out well . a good *** ( * ) a touch closed again on the nose and quite tannic on the palate . again i guess this will open up beautifully . *** ( * ) high-toned cherry fruit right through the palate . charming , nice tannins , decent acidity . very good . ** ( * ) ripe , very pure , cherry-like again . pretty exciting wine , needing a few years yet . top ** ( * ) fresh , complex , lovely balance , this does not seem heavily extracted with its graceful elegance . very fine . top *** i do n't seem to have tasted so much this year and the notes are hurried . too much good conversation ! vinous nose , floral and rich fruit . i good length , but it does seem very wood-influenced . no dosage , i believe , but it seems well-balanced . *** a `` solera wine '' i gather . yeasty , rather good . i must try a bottle properly one day . top *** tangy , salty , lovely old wine . top *** very fine and elegant with good intensity and length . unless it fills out , it seems a little light on the mid-palate . perhaps i am under-rating this - for now a top *** very elegant and fine - everything one could hope for from a second wine . about time to drink . *** medium weight and nicely resolved . pleasant drinking . bare *** a big rounded , fruity mouthful . quite tannic and a touch awkward now , as this vintage often seems to be . needs a bit of time still . *** fantastic texture and density , really good . so suave . **** ( * ) difficult nose at first but opens out , showing silky-textured fruit with a lovely unforced concentration . should try a bottle properly at some point . for now at least *** sa portugese oddity - piquant , high-toned , rather interesting . *** lovely - mouthwatering and delicious . scrapes **** seems rather evolved at first - takes time to open up . when it does it has amazing intensity and length . the flavours centre around mushrooms and slow-moving rivers . lovely . ***** dry , intense , long . benchmark wine , i feel . **** fragrant , dry , a mid-palate hole but with time in the glass , lovely . **** classic old mosel sweety -in pretty good condition . a good *** dry , keroseney , long . pretty much dry , in the trimbach style . excellent . **** ravishing , fragrant nose . middle-weight - balanced , long , lovely . a top ***** more sauvage , with bright fruit . still quite tannic - could do with a couple of year . it wo n't be quite as graceful as the chave , but it 's very , very good . **** ( * ) porty - needs time - dry and flavoursome . top **** very fine , dry , ripe but not overblown . classic cabernet cedaryness too . top **** nice rich , grassy , good . *** fine , elegant , possibly a touch spirity . very classy but it perhaps needs to be studied carefully on a fairly clean palate . still , i think **** a bit sulphury . sauvignon dominated - like an oaked nz wine . banana-like fruit . bare ** much richer and better-textured . rounded , moderate acidity . quite impressive . *** very immediate hit of warm-climate-like cab . easy-going - fine for a bbq . no great finish . bare ** ripe nose - touch of tobacco . soft - yet not overstated . tannins and oak evident on the finish . not the sort of wine i personally want to buy , but rather good in its way . a good *** quite forward - elegant - tannins resolved - dry finish - not so long . bare *** lighter , but with some extra spice . a bit grippier than the 2000 . quite complex and structured - drinking quite nicely . top *** black cherry , high-toned , tannic , some doubts about the underlying concentration . top *** very closed . becomes honeyed and delicious - needs decanting . provence herbs - bags of character . *** ( * ) fine , attractive nose but the fruit while initially exciting is marred by a bitter twist towards the finish . this defect seems less evident a day later - while the wine seems quite mature , i wonder if it might benefit from more time . pretty good . *** cashews , yeasty bread , honey , creamy fruit - a different character on returning each time . taught acidity and good length . really fine - perhaps even **** ( * ) brioche and honey nose , quite citric ( lemon and grapefruit ) palate . a little disjointed still but time will draw it together nicely . softly frothy now , as one might expect from its youth . very good . *** ( * ) most of my recent notes of this wine have been from a single case bought at auction a while ago . i have since discovered from the nice people at gosset that it is a 93+94+95 blend . lovely honey and apples with yeasty undertones . some will say it is showing a touch of oxidative character and i suppose it is although i do n't find it remotely a problem . very rich but now in perfect balance . **** quitelarge-framed , a bit coarse and difficult towards the finish - perhaps a year in bottle would help . ok , but i 'm not wild about this . from a half . bare *** doughy but floral nose , quite tight , dry and precise , elegant palate - decent length but with a touch of hardness that needs a year or two . very good . bare *** ( * ) lost in my filing system - this is from dinner at a byo restaurant a few months ago , but i ca n't recall when . mainstream chassagne . pretty good . *** a bit woody - extravagent oak as often with grivot . dry and austerely planky . i 'm not so keen - others may like more . ** very pleasant gamy old thing . drink soon . bare *** oozes minerality , approachable but time will doubtless improve this . very nice . bare *** ( * ) rasins , a touch of oxidation , sweet pruney palate . ok but unremarkable . ** lightweight , almondy , quite fine . picquant and medicinal . attractive as a lunchtime port ! a good *** elegant , lightweight , fresh and bright . rather nice . top *** very pale - the colour has dropped out as sediment . madeira-like nose , pleasant port palate . ** quite pale , rather eveloved ( the level is bottom-shoulder which might be the reason ) . rather savoury and delicious but not quite what it ought to be , i feel . top *** very pale , mushrooms and biscuits . probably very old ( some paper labels claim some of these bottles as 1850 's - if any are , it 's this one ) and past its best . ** from different source and showing up all the previous wines . lovely graceful old wine , fruity and scented , still fresh . it develops in the glass and is completely delicious . top ***** nutty , yeasty , lovely mature champagne . bare ***** quite forward , slightly fat 98 style . completely healthy but for drinking . top *** mineral , clear , fine . a stunning effort for the vintage . top **** still a touch hard but very fine . **** ( * ) probably substantially north african ! bare *** lovely mature claret . perhaps even a bare **** dry , very smoky , quite baked fruit . seems younger than its years . **** ( * ) gummy , quite intense , in-your-face stuff . ** rounded , very deeply coloured . rather good . top *** very rancio , cloudy ( and still so the next day ) . rich and thick and with something of ozzie liquor muscat about it . curious . top *** yeasty , very nice - champagne quality although different in character . *** tight , lovely , classic white burgundy*** ( * ) rather evolved - creamy marzipan . very good but might have been better a few years ago . top *** very much real wine , this oozes strength and individuality . might well improve further . very nice . makes an interesting comparison with the roda : i prefer this because its much less international . a good *** cassisy , peppery fruit . rather international , but good of its sort . *** very classic , dry , tannic , high-toned . top *** rich fruit . elegant - seems rather good . ( this wine passed me by a bit - i think i was chatting too much and concentrating not enough - my main memory is jsut that it was very good . ) still , *** ( * ) spicey , rich , very m-c. *** elegant , lovely balance . class always tells . bare **** very marmaladey , soft , delicious . i need to think more about this - is it tokay somehow as it should be , or is it turned into something else for the modern market . i 'm not sure yet , and i need to drink a couple of glasses more contemplatively . still , it 's at least very impressive . **** nicely shaped bottle , and reasobale stuff inside it . a bit coarse and woody , and a bit too sweet . ** ( * ) i think i 've had this for a few years . it 's certainly worth keeping . lovely honeyed and mineral palate . a joy . just goes to show that you should n't rush drinking champagne ! top *** ok , but nothing out of the ordinary . ** i have n't had koonunga hill for ages . i was pleasantly surprised . very penfolds in style ( no bad thing to my mind ) - velvety smooth , not trying to be too big , gentle on the head . *** good nose , but not typical . a really very coarse palate . * rather fine fruit with just a touch of lychee - not very varietal now , more mineral - some will say too old but i think its at a peak . pleasingly dry too - quite a fine wine . is this just age or is this old-style zind before the days of extra residual sugar ? whatever , it 's rather nice . top *** tarry , fragrant , everything you could want from a typical , good barolo in a decent but not special vintage . needs drinking in the next few years . top *** rather deliciously smooth and fragrantly , softly volnay . i noted after a while that this had been tarted up with quite a lot of new oak . very good of its kind , and quite good even in absolute terms . *** lovely old-wine nose , fresh fruit . coarsened after 30 minutes or so and faded a bit . still rather pleasant . no indication on this half as to whether this was a riserva or anything . bare *** nicely made , fruity but not vulgar . very drinkable . bare ** no excessive 2003 flab although i 'd like a bit more precision and minerality . decent wine . ** excellent fruit , especially given the vintage . gamy and mineral . a lovely mouthful but the finish is a touch harsh . still **** nice weight , attractive fruit but it seemed a bit flabby - maybe just a touch warm . *** creamy , fragrant , delicate , quite fine . butterscotch background to greengage fruit . completely fresh with a long finish . ( magnum ) ***** excellent - tropical-edged very lemony fruit . some oak i think . nice balance and very rich . big - a bit modern but very good . aiming at the beaucastel rousanne vv style perhaps . *** very fizzy to the extent of being a fault . but it wears off enough to form a judgement - quite mineral and characterful . serious wine that i 'd like to try again . at least a good *** lovely , creamy , fine acidity , good length . appetizing . lovely . **** a touch closed and struck matches too . opens out - great concentration . a top *** ( * ) nice rich fruit , dry long . top *** still red pinot noir from champagne . so soft and silky . gorgeously round . easy-going . one of the best non-burgundian pinots i have tasted . top *** beetroot fruit - harder than the previous wines . very baked and extracted . this is really not a success . ** lots of grippy tannins . highly-wrought and oaky . not my sort of thing - but striking . certainly needs time but what will happen ? *** very fine - deep , rich , silky with a lovely refined , dry palate . splendid for vintage , but could one regret the lack of c-r typicity ? ***** rich pineapple , nice acid . very pleasant . bare *** lighter at the final analysis - although more mouthfilling . top ** bright , both metaphorically and literally . a touch hard on the finish still although coming round to drinking . a touch short of the richness you might hope for from grahams in this vintage . still worth *** ( * ) acacia , nuts . intense , dry , long . drinking but no hurry . **** lime , herbs , cream . not heavy on the palate - lovely . top **** big and muscular - grand cru intensity and rich finish . very good . *** ( * ) fragrant , piquant cranberry , yet meaty ( bovril ) nose . excellent for the vintage . partly on the basis of interest - a bare **** promoted conversation - apart from anything else putting a wax seal on an australian wine is making a statement . a touch mineral , quite complex fruit - pure too and not overstated . personally , i still find an overlying minty sweetness in the finish not to my taste although that might be less noticable with the right food . interesting wine that somebody with more of a taste for australian style might rate a bit more . still *** fat , nice botrytis , a touch of paint-stripper and not so long . good ** less intense , less flawed and follows through a bit better to the finish . nice . *** lightweight yet concentrated . ethereal , complex chocolatey fruit . lovely . ***** these three wines were very kindly sent by the winery who had noticed that fwd is n't always very kind to beaujolais . i tasted these with ljm ( sometime contributor to fwd ) . i 'm afraid that these three wines still failed to convince me completely about beaujolais . but they have persuaded me that i need to try a few more . earthy , fresh fruity zingy nose with a hint of vanilla - good texture on the palate . my favourite of the three wines for drinking now . *** i 'm afraid i could n't really get on with this wine - it seemed light and dilute and was a touch green at the end . possibly a faulty bottle so i wo n't score not rated quite a soft wine - maturity taking over from the earlier gamay vibrancy i guess . initially a bit dumb and subdued , but after time the wine opened out . it would be interesting to try this in another couple of years to see whether it is just at a bit of an inbetween phase . for now *** excellent condition at 10 years old , very good fruit too , although for some reason i could not get that excited about it . still a decent *** my last bottle of this - and has n't it kept well . completely fresh but fully mature , quite soft and very pleasingly drinkable . *** very juicy with a touch of italianate bitterness to give it a grown-up appeal . finishes a touch abruptly perhaps . a good * a glass at valvona 's vincafe , even so clearly very elegant , refined , blanced and generally yummy . *** very classy , loads of fruit , fairly forward , drinking very nicely . top *** on opening , quite tough - you have to like tannins for this . it does have the most fantastic ripe fruit though and 24 hours after opening it had really opened out . delicious . easy *** this guy is one hell of a winemaker . this has concentrated tarry raspberry fruit on the nose , bags of tannins ( which are ripe enough to be enjoyable even at this stage ) , super concentration and texture and a long finish . high-toned , despite being a bit more forward than the 96 . excellent . easily *** ( * ) written from memory a day or two later : surprisingly old-fashioned orange-rimmed colour . quite forward and easy-going , drinking ok at the moment in fact but surely more time can only improve matters . very classy . *** quite dry , fairly austere but very good , particularly with some nibbles . bare *** ( * ) more forward and fragrant , not really noticably sweeter . good *** this is half chardonnay and half pinot meunier - the latter not that apparent . very yeasty , seems a bit four-square at the moment ( perhaps that is where one sees the p-m ) . rich and really very long . clearly need quite a lot of time , and i can see it could well be very good in a decade or so , although it might be a bit light on finesse . bare ** ( ** ) curious - very exotic , vanillan , and highly vinous . not everyones idea of champagne , but you ca n't say it lacks character . i need to drink this over an evening ( with food ) and see how my relationship with it develops . for now a top *** dry , real puligny , quite intense . not special but it does what it says on the tin . *** quite rich , mouthfilling wine . lacks the classic finesse that marks out the stars . top *** nice fruit - pure , intense . *** a bit more oaky - but quality fruit again . *** seepage round the cork ( under the capsule ) . odd but not undrinkable - clearly faulty . not rated depths , depths and more depths . really lovely , both rich and piquant . very top *** ( * ) burnt , dense , exotic , meaty . tannic . austere , difficult . this might yet come good , and even now it is arresting and interesting drinking . risky to rely on it evolving well , but if all goes well *** ( * ) attractive green rim - never a bad sign . on the palate , like a really fine old madeira in every way except there is not the real intensity or searing acidity on the palate . the flavours however are very fine and this is a lovely drink . top *** chocolatey fruit - very nice old colheita . top *** possibly a touch too old now , but lovely old champagne nonetheless . mature and elegant for its depth . **** one of the first wines i bought with a view to keeping . i love old white burgundy , and this did n't let me down . lovely , oily , nutty ethereal stuff . **** disappointing . not past it , but just not particularly special . maybe it still needs loads more time to develop ? ** lovely pure beetroot and raspberry nose . drinking very well . silky . ***** ok , so we drank this thinking it was showing well for the 1978 vintage . the label was n't in the best condition . the next morning i was just sorting through the corks when i noticed we had really been drinking the 1982 . the last time i had this wine i was disappointed , and i was again this time . it 's ok , but it has n't got the structure or depth expected . *** stylish nose , slightly resinous - a bit thin on the palate . pleasant . * slightly flat , flavoursome , a bit rustic . interesting , up to a point . * rich fruit . lovely burgundy . good intensity and structure . needs time . top *** ( * ) mothbally at first . disjointed but intense palate . emerges - needs time . will be great i suspect . *** ( ** ) honied nose , strong palate . quite evolved - ready in fact and needing drinking over the next few years , i suspect . even unflawed 96 's seem to be aging quite quickly . **** open , peachy , luxurious . a little light , some thought , but i loved it . **** cough-sweet and smoky . interesting , but slightly harsh on the finish . perhaps needs time . *** ( * ) grenachey , cassis overtones - quite raw finish . a bit rubbery . ** caramel nose . a touch rough , perhaps . opens out - quite classically chateauneuf . top *** nice balance , clearly warm-vintage . a lovely balance of slavours . coming round to drinking quite fast . a good **** yummy drinkability . stands up in this company - if a bit simple . *** fragrant nose . gummy , rich , very fine . **** a touch woody . pleasant , persistent , but perhaps a bit thin . bare *** burnt , a bit thin . bare ** fragrant fruit , a touch hard , a touch of aniseed . fairly lightweight . top *** my memory of vintages of this provence wine from some years ago is of the fruit being a bit sweet - this though seems rather good : provencal herbs over cassis fruit with a lot of smoky cigar box . very much a point and it has kept well . a little simple perhaps but i believe this was not a particularly good vintage for the property . good effort - i 'd like to try some other vintages . *** quite concentrated and flavoursome , but lacking finesse for me in a way that i 'm not sure more time will alleviate . pleasant then but not fantastic . *** smoke and pepper - fruit gently weakening perhaps but very drinkable . *** blackberry and apple fruit with interesting sauvage overtones - once open for a few hours , very stylish indeed . will probably improve for a year or two . *** a bit stinky on opening - it blows off to some extent but a touch of something foetid remains . still , quite a dense , brown-sugar palate follows with a hint of volatility or something . good rather than exceptional . *** fruity , grassy - like a new world semillon . pleasant enough . * nice fruit quality - quite suave . decent length . top * very fresh raspberry fruit with a meaty underlay . very refined texture and good length . once it has been open a while it seems even more burgundian . it needs a bit more minerality or something to be truly outstanding . scrapes **** slate , sherbert , a touch sour as msr wines can be . good length , maybe a touch hollow in the middle - something i find occasionally with the vintage . fine , but not exceptional by the high standards of the domain . top *** quite tight and closed , but opens out with time as it warms up . excellent intensity and a long brioche finish . good balance . **** ( * ) very thin and dull . drinkable but no stars modern-styled , but very nicely done . limey acidity . satisfying , but completely upstaged by the jobard that follows . *** more reserved , but much more complexity and `` beyond-fruit '' flavours . excellent . *** ( * ) dry , reserved , quite persistent . rather good . bare *** ( * ) oxidised - but it did have a slightly loose cork . not rated softer and rounder than the lafarge below . still quite piquant on the palate . *** dry , fragrant , good length . fairly austere at first and less flattering than the jadot wine . might till improve touch , while the jadot is ready . *** open 24 hours . seems good . quite mineral . *** sold to me in oddbins as the wine that beat dom perignon in a recent competition . actually it might have been the nv blin that did this - different assistants in oddbins attributed the result to both wines . this wine is good , but not dp good . there 's a touch of sweetness and some heaviness of hand . ** ( * ) good strawberry nose and pleasantly elegant palate . *** drinkable . * rich , quite forward ( sepcially for the vintage ) , the quality shows in the persistence . lovely juniper/gin edge to the nose . **** a belnd of 95 and 96 . strawberry fruit , impressive at first but it does seem simple compared to the deutz . weighty but not so intense . good though for the price . *** quite varietal but with an added complexity and some non-fruit chatracter that makes it stand out . drinking very nicely . top *** lighter and a touch vegetal . a touch thin but nevertheless it is a wine of character . top ** richer again , as with the 93 you might struggle to spot the grape variety : no bad thing in my mind . an interesting mature wine *** very fine , very characteristically southern rhone . top *** really quite northern rhone-like and very stylish , gamy syrah . **** very complex , smoky wine . really lovely . scrapes ***** gamy but elegant . a little overawed by the rayas wines , but fine . bare **** balanced and rich , but perhaps not showing ideally now . a little more time might help . still **** very creamy but not rich . dies a bit in the glass . interesting , and pretty good for an average vintage , vineyard , etc . top ** difficult on opening - gamy almost and austere . opens out nicely . top *** nicely set up and needing a bit of time yet . i feel this has n't the fineness to be great but it is very good . *** ( * ) < /ul >\""
